Democrats blast Cheney secrecy after shooting
ATTENTION - ADDS Cheney statement ///
</S><S s_id="1">
Democrats in Congress on Tuesday accused Vice President Dick Cheney of a pattern of secrecy, and demanded that he "level" with the public, after keeping mum about accidentally shooting an associate over the weekend.
</S><S s_id="2">
Cheney has been criticized for waiting a day before disclosing a hunting mishap Saturday in which he shot his 78-year-old hunting companion, Harry Whittington, in the neck, chest, and face.
</S><S s_id="3">
Asked at a press conference for her reaction about how the White House has handled the incident, US Senator Hillary Clinton called the Bush administration's failure to be more forthcoming "troubling."
</S><S s_id="4">
"A tendency of this administration -- from the top all the way to the bottom -- is to withhold information ... to refuse to be forthcoming about information that is of significance and relevance to the jobs that all of you do, and the interests of the American people," Clinton said.
</S><S s_id="5">
"Putting it all together, going back years now, there's a pattern and it's a pattern that should be troubling," she said at a press conference calling for a more robust federal response to the Hurricane Katrina disaster.
</S><S s_id="6">
The former first lady continued: "The refusal of this administration to level with the American people on matters large and small is very disturbing, because it goes counter to the way our constitutional democracy ... is supposed to work."
</S><S s_id="7">
Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid at a press conference Tuesday said the secretive tendency goes beyond Cheney, pervading the entire Bush the White House.
</S><S s_id="8">
"I think the reason it took the vice president a day to talk about this is part of the secretive nature of this administration," the top Senate Democrat said.
</S><S s_id="9">
"They keep things pretty close to the chest."
</S><S s_id="10">
"I think it's time the American people heard from the vice president, in a real meeting just like we're having here," said Reid, who called the George W. Bush presidency "the most secretive administration in modern history."
</S><S s_id="11">
"In the last many, many decades, there's no administration more secretive than this," he said.
</S><S s_id="12">
Cheney has not commented publicly about the accident, which took place on the 50,000-acre Armstrong Ranch in Texas on Saturday, although he issued a statement Tuesday saying that his "thoughts and prayers" were with his friend, and that he stood ready to help Whittington in any way.
</S><S s_id="13">
"The vice president said that his thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Whittington and his family," the statement said.
</S><S s_id="14">
Allegations that he is obsessively secretive have dogged Cheney since the early days of the Bush presidency, including his refusal during the administration's first term to reveal the participants on energy task force he led.
</S><S s_id="15">
The vice president also has been criticized for a possible role in helping craft the administration's controversial secret domestic wiretapping policy.
</S><S s_id="16">
Meanwhile, his chief of staff, Scooter Libby, has been implicated in secretly leaking the name of a CIA officer to discredit her husband -- an action some recent news accounts suggest may have been sanctioned by Cheney.
</S><S s_id="17">
Senator Chuck Schumer said Tuesday the time has come for the vice president to hold a press conference -- which Schumer said would be Cheney's first in some four years -- to clear the air.
</S><S s_id="18">
"In light of the recent shooting accident and all the questions surrounding his role in the leaking of classified national security information through his Chief of Staff Lewis Libby, there are many questions that Americans have for VP Cheney," Schumer said in a press release.

Cheney ducks public after shooting

</S><S s_id="1">
US Vice President Dick Cheney continued to keep a low profile Wednesday as his shooting of a hunting partner over the weekend and the White House's handling of the incident mushroomed into a political controversy.
</S><S s_id="2">
Cheney -- who has yet to express regret publicly for wounding 78-year-old Texas lawyer Harry Whittington in the neck, chest and face -- called him in his hospital room Tuesday to offer help and best wishes, the vice president's office said.
</S><S s_id="3">
Doctors blamed birdshot that shifted to Whittington's heart for a mild heart attack he suffered Tuesday, and said that while his life was not in immediate danger, and no surgery was needed to remove the lodged metal, he would have to stay in hospital another week.
</S><S s_id="4">
Whittington has developed an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation, which can lead to the formation of blood clots that can cause a stroke if they move to the brain.
</S><S s_id="5">
Cheney managed to duck a battalion of reporters staking out a meeting he had with lawmakers Tuesday, and White House aides said he had no plans to come forward with his account of the incident.
</S><S s_id="6">
Amid criticism of the White House for waiting to announce the shooting accident for nearly 21 hours, two former Republican presidential press secretaries said Cheney should have reported the incident to the public without delay.
</S><S s_id="7">
"It could have and should have been handled differently," Ari Fleischer, President George W. Bush's first spokesman from 2001 to 2003, told the magazine Editor and Publisher.
</S><S s_id="8">
Marlin Fitzwater, who served as press secretary to Bush's father and to late former president Ronald Reagan, told the same publication he was "appalled" at how the administration had handled the incident.
</S><S s_id="9">
The vice president's office said that his first public event would be on Friday, in Cheyenne, Wyoming -- but that he was not likely to explain how a quail hunt on the Texas ranch of Katharine Armstrong on Saturday nearly turned tragic.
</S><S s_id="10">
Cheney's office has refused to provide an official account of the hunting incident, pointing reporters to Armstrong -- a private citizen with no formal ties to the White House.
</S><S s_id="11">
President Bush's current chief spokesman, Scott McClellan, served notice that there would be no official, formal White House account of how the incident occurred, even as he signalled impatience with questions about it.
</S><S s_id="12">
"You all can spend your time on it.
</S><S s_id="13">
We're going to keep focusing on the pressing priorities of the American people, like talking about how to make health care more affordable and accessible," said the spokesman.
</S><S s_id="14">
McClellan, who learned of Whittington's heart attack just before his main daily briefing, declined to be drawn by questions about the nearly 21-hour gap between the incident and when it was made public, or why the news came from the ranch owner rather than official channels.
</S><S s_id="15">
"What happened has been explained," he insisted.
</S><S s_id="16">
Democratic Senator Hillary Clinton called Cheney's handling of the situation "troubling" and said "a tendency of this administration, from the top all the way to the bottom, is to withhold information."
</S><S s_id="17">
While Cheney's Republican allies accused the US media of overreacting, the mood grew somber after doctors at Christus Spohn Hospital Memorial in Corpus Christi, Texas, reported the heart attack.
</S><S s_id="18">
Hospital spokesman Peter Banko said Whittington would have to stay in their care for seven more days "to make sure no more birdshot moves into vital organs, as well as that piece of birdshot doesn't move anywhere else in the heart."
</S><S s_id="19">
Dozens of pieces of birdshot -- tiny pellets about 5 millimeters in diameter -- remain lodged in Whittington's body.
</S><S s_id="20">
Cheney, who visited Whittington in the hospital on Sunday, telephoned him Tuesday afternoon to offer his help and tell him that "his thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Whittington and his family," the vice president's office said in a statement.
</S><S s_id="21">
"Mr. Whittington's spirits were good, but obviously his situation deserves the careful monitoring that his doctors are providing," it said.

Lawyer in Hunting Accident Suffers Mild Heart Attack

Lawyer in Hunting Accident Suffers Mild Heart Attack
</S><S s_id="1">
Harry M. Whittington, the 78-year-old hunter accidentally shot by Vice President Dick Cheney, was back in intensive care Tuesday after suffering a mild heart attack, as questions continued to swirl around the White House's handling of the incident.
</S><S s_id="2">
Doctors treating Whittington said a shotgun pellet that lodged in his chest had triggered what they described as a "silent heart attack."
</S><S s_id="3">
He was reported in stable condition at the Corpus Christi, Texas, hospital where he has been treated since the shooting on Saturday.
</S><S s_id="4">
Cheney, who has yet to comment publicly on the shooting, was quoted in a statement from his office as saying that he had spoken with Whittington after learning of his condition and that "his thoughts and prayers are with" the Austin, Texas, attorney.
</S><S s_id="5">
Doctors who briefed reporters at an afternoon news conference outside Christus Spohn Hospital Corpus Christi-Memorial said that Whittington did not experience chest pains or other classic symptoms of a heart attack.
</S><S s_id="6">
They said the pellet, which they decided to leave in place, had caused inflammation of the heart muscle that caused a temporary blockage of blood flow.
</S><S s_id="7">
David Blanchard, chief of emergency medicine at the hospital, said doctors were "very, very optimistic" that Whittington would make a full recovery.
</S><S s_id="8">
Still, the heart attack revealed that Cheney's misfire, first regarded as more embarrassing than life-threatening, had potentially put his victim's health in greater danger, after doctors and White House officials initially had described Whittington as on the mend from minor injuries.
</S><S s_id="9">
It also derailed a concerted White House effort to move past the hunting episode, which has tarnished Cheney's image and highlighted his penchant for secrecy, while thrusting Bush's top aides, including press secretary Scott McClellan, into a tug-of-war with the media.
</S><S s_id="10">
Cheney's office -- under blistering attack for failing to make a public announcement about the shooting -- reversed course and issued a detailed statement about his concern for Whittington.
</S><S s_id="11">
It recounted a phone call Cheney made to Whittington after learning of his condition, in which the vice president wished him well "and asked if there was anything he needed," the statement said.
</S><S s_id="12">
Cheney "said that he stood ready to assist," it added.
</S><S s_id="13">
Doctors said Whittington was expected to remain at the hospital for a week for treatment and observation.
</S><S s_id="14">
Doctors in Washington, whom Blanchard described as White House physicians, have been consulting with cardiologists at Christus Spohn on Whittington's care, Blanchard said.
</S><S s_id="15">
He said they had agreed that it would be in the elderly patient's best interests to treat him with "medical therapy," rather than surgery.
</S><S s_id="16">
The vice president learned of the change in Whittington's condition Tuesday morning, and watched part of the televised hospital news conference, the statement from his office said.
</S><S s_id="17">
After that briefing, the release added, Cheney placed a call to Whittington.
</S><S s_id="18">
Even as the White House struggled for a second straight day to defend its handling of the shooting, McClellan continued to withhold certain details.
</S><S s_id="19">
He was informed of Whittington's heart troubles before his televised briefing and before the Corpus Christi news conference in which they were disclosed, but he did not mention the developments during the 27-minute exchange, which was dominated by questions about the hunting accident.
</S><S s_id="20">
"You're welcome to continue to focus on these issues," McClellan told reporters.
</S><S s_id="21">
"I'm moving on."
</S><S s_id="22">
McClellan later said he did not reveal the change in Whittington's condition because "it's not appropriate for me to" do so.
</S><S s_id="23">
"I'm not his doctor; that's for his doctor to talk about."
</S><S s_id="24">
He also said there were "privacy issues" preventing him from commenting on the matter.
</S><S s_id="25">
As the focus turned to Whittington's health, new details continued to emerge about what took place on the 50,000-acre southeast Texas ranch where the accident occurred.
</S><S s_id="26">
Katherine Armstrong, a lobbyist whose family owns the ranch, indicated in interviews that she and other members of her family, not Cheney, had decided it was necessary to inform the public about the incident.
</S><S s_id="27">
After making that decision over breakfast Sunday morning, she and her mother, Anne Armstrong, a former top Republican official, "ran it by" Cheney, Katherine Armstrong told The Dallas Morning News.
</S><S s_id="28">
She added that Cheney "said something along the lines of, 'You all do whatever you are comfortable with.'
</S><S s_id="29">
"
</S><S s_id="30">
Katherine Armstrong has lobbied the Bush administration on agriculture issues and lobbied the White House last year on South Korean policy on behalf of South Korean clients, according to federal records.
</S><S s_id="31">
The sheriff's office in KenedyCounty, where the Armstrong Ranch is located, issued a news release about Saturday's incident saying "there was no alcohol, or misconduct involved," and that "this department is fully satisfied that this was no more than a hunting accident."
</S><S s_id="32">
Carlos Valdez, the district attorney who prosecutes criminal cases in Kenedy County, said he had yet to speak with the sheriff's officials but is satisfied with what he knows of their investigation.
</S><S s_id="33">
In Corpus Christi, doctors said they had performed a cardiac catheterization on Whittington, a procedure used to discover whether arteries around the heart are blocked and there has been damage to heart function.
</S><S s_id="34">
Johns Hopkins University cardiologist Rick Lang said the patient likely had a good prognosis.
</S><S s_id="35">
This kind of problem usually resolves on its own within one or two weeks, he said.
</S><S s_id="36">
Doctors were unsure of precisely where the birdshot near Whittington's heart had lodged, Blanchard said.
</S><S s_id="37">
Mandeep Mehra, chief of cardiology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, said the pellet might have ended up in the pericardium, the heart's protective covering.
</S><S s_id="38">
If so, it could have inflamed this covering; this inflammation can also spread to the heart's chambers.

Questions Remain on Shooting by Cheney

Questions Remain on Shooting by Cheney
</S><S s_id="1">
Vice President Dick Cheney's public mea culpa Wednesday did little to clear up significant questions surrounding the accidental shooting, including why the White House sat on the story for almost a full day and whether he received preferential treatment from local deputies.
</S><S s_id="2">
Here is a look at some of those questions:
</S><S s_id="3">
Q.
</S><S s_id="4">
Why didn't the White House notify the public immediately Saturday night that the vice president accidentally shot a man?
</S><S s_id="5">
A.
</S><S s_id="6">
Cheney makes it clear that it was his decision to wait almost a full day to go public.
</S><S s_id="7">
But he doesn't indicate why top Bush aides like Karl Rove -- and even President Bush himself -- appear to have deferred to him on it.
</S><S s_id="8">
Q.
</S><S s_id="9">
Why didn't Cheney just put the word out Saturday night to avoid risking charges coming from critics now of a cover-up?
</S><S s_id="10">
A.
</S><S s_id="11">
Cheney said he waited overnight to find out how seriously victim Harry Whittington was hurt and to avoid rushing out inaccurate information.
</S><S s_id="12">
Q.
</S><S s_id="13">
Did Rove, Bush chief of staff Andrew Card or even Bush himself want Cheney to go public Saturday night?
</S><S s_id="14">
A.
</S><S s_id="15">
Unknown.
</S><S s_id="16">
In one of the more striking statements from the nation's No. 2 leader, Cheney says he didn't personally speak to anyone at the White House until Sunday morning, despite having been involved in the shooting accident the night before.
</S><S s_id="17">
Rove told Bush at about 8 p.m. Saturday that Cheney was the shooter -- roughly an hour after the shooting occurred.
</S><S s_id="18">
Q.
</S><S s_id="19">
The White House has an elaborate media operation -- why did Cheney bypass it and the national media outlets that cover the White House around the clock?
</S><S s_id="20">
A.
</S><S s_id="21">
Also unclear.
</S><S s_id="22">
Cheney said only that he had no spokesperson traveling with him, even though his traveling staff can be in 24-7 contact with the White House.
</S><S s_id="23">
But Cheney has done little in his five years in office to disguise his disdain for the national media.
</S><S s_id="24">
Q.
</S><S s_id="25">
How did Cheney decide to alert the news media?
</S><S s_id="26">
A.
</S><S s_id="27">
On Sunday, ranch owner Katharine Armstrong initially told CNN that she tipped off the local newspaper without first talking to Cheney.
</S><S s_id="28">
But by Monday, the White House said Cheney agreed with her suggestion and told her to give the story to a reporter she knew at the Corpus Christi Caller-Times.
</S><S s_id="29">
Q.
</S><S s_id="30">
Why didn't the local sheriff's office talk to Cheney on the same day as the shooting?
</S><S s_id="31">
A.
</S><S s_id="32">
Kenedy County Sheriff Ramon Salinas III and the federal Secret Service have given conflicting accounts.
</S><S s_id="33">
On Sunday, Salinas told The New York Times that a deputy talked to Cheney Saturday night.
</S><S s_id="34">
But CBS said the sheriff's office complained a deputy had been turned away that evening.
</S><S s_id="35">
On Monday, the Secret Service said its agents called Salinas soon after the shooting and arranged for a Sunday morning meeting with Cheney.
</S><S s_id="36">
Salinas said he decided not to send a deputy Saturday night.
</S><S s_id="37">
Q.
</S><S s_id="38">
Why didn't the sheriff charge Cheney in the shooting?
</S><S s_id="39">
A.
</S><S s_id="40">
Salinas said he decided it was an accident Saturday after talking to the Secret Service and a ranch hand he described as a former deputy and Salinas' daughter's boyfriend.
</S><S s_id="41">
Salinas said Cheney and Whittington also told deputies it was accidental.
</S><S s_id="42">
If Whittington dies, however, the county prosecutor has said he might impanel a grand jury to investigate.
</S><S s_id="43">
Q.
</S><S s_id="44">
Whose fault was the shooting?
</S><S s_id="45">
A.
</S><S s_id="46">
Cheney Wednesday took full responsibility for the shooting, saying, "You can't blame anybody else.
</S><S s_id="47">
I'm the guy who pulled the trigger and shot my friend."
</S><S s_id="48">
But for three days, he let his friend and hunting host, Armstrong, blame the victim, saying it was Whittington's fault for not telling other members of the hunting party he was nearby.
</S><S s_id="49">
In the end, hunting experts say it's one of the cardinal rules of hunting, that responsibility ultimately lies with the shooter.
</S><S s_id="50">
"You should know what you're shooting," said one veteran Texas hunting guide.

Cheney Accepts Blame for Accidental Shooting

Cheney Accepts Blame for Accidental Shooting
</S><S s_id="1">
Vice President Dick Cheney said in a broadcast interview Wednesday that he accepts full blame for mistakenly shooting a hunting partner last weekend, abandoning his tight-lipped stance on an accident that has drawn sharp criticism and proved damaging to the Bush administration.
</S><S s_id="2">
In his first public comments on the incident, Cheney called the day of the shooting "one of the worst days of my life," appearing somber and shaken as he described having shot Harry M. Whittington, a 78-year-old Austin, Texas, lawyer last Saturday afternoon.
</S><S s_id="3">
But Cheney was unrepentant during the 27-minute interview with Brit Hume of Fox News Channel about his decision not to tell the news media about the accident until the next day.
</S><S s_id="4">
Cheney acknowledged waiting until after he knew "that Harry was probably going to be OK" before allowing it to be disclosed.
</S><S s_id="5">
At that point, Cheney said, leaving it to the owner of the Texas ranch where the shooting occurred to contact one local reporter "was the right call."
</S><S s_id="6">
The vice president's decision to discuss the incident came after three days of intense criticism and was an unusual move for Cheney, who rarely grants interviews and then largely to conservative TV and radio commentators whose audience regards him as a hero.
</S><S s_id="7">
In this case, said Jennifer Mayfield, a spokeswoman, Cheney "just wanted to talk to the American people, and we thought an interview would be the best way to do so."
</S><S s_id="8">
Cheney used the opportunity to show a more human side to an accident that has made him the butt of jokes and scathing criticism, and become a liability for a White House struggling to improve its image in an election year.
</S><S s_id="9">
Since Sunday, the incident has distracted attention from President Bush's activities, such as his visit Wednesday to Ohio to promote his health care proposals.
</S><S s_id="10">
It has also served to underscore criticism of Cheney and the administration as secretive and raised new questions about their credibility.
</S><S s_id="11">
Cheney said he is still haunted by the shooting.
</S><S s_id="12">
"The image of him falling is something I'll never ever be able to get out of my mind.
</S><S s_id="13">
I fired, and there's Harry falling.
</S><S s_id="14">
It was, I'd have to say, one of the worst days of my life at that moment," said Cheney, who was interviewed in his ceremonial office in the old Executive Office Building next door to the White House.
</S><S s_id="15">
The vice president broke with allies who had suggested that Whittington was at fault for wandering unannounced into Cheney's line of fire.
</S><S s_id="16">
"I'm the guy who pulled the trigger that fired the round that hit Harry.
</S><S s_id="17">
You can talk about all of the other conditions that exist at the time but that's the bottom line, and it was not Harry's fault," Cheney said.
</S><S s_id="18">
"You can't blame anybody else.
</S><S s_id="19">
I'm the guy who pulled the trigger and shot my friend."
</S><S s_id="20">
Whittington was in stable condition at a hospital in Corpus Christi, Texas, officials there said.
</S><S s_id="21">
He is under observation after one of the pellets Cheney shot Saturday moved to his heart, causing inflammation and restricting blood flow in what doctors described as a minor heart attack early Tuesday.
</S><S s_id="22">
Cheney's hastily scheduled interview was a change in course by the vice president, whose office shared few details about the accident.
</S><S s_id="23">
It came as prominent Republicans and public relations specialists were criticizing the White House for its handling of the story.
</S><S s_id="24">
Marlin Fitzwater, who served as White House press secretary for Ronald Reagan and the first President Bush, faulted Cheney for the approach in an interview with Editor &amp; Publisher, saying he "ignored his responsibility to the American people."
</S><S s_id="25">
Fitzwater told the magazine's Web site that he was "appalled by the whole handling of this."
</S><S s_id="26">
Cheney defended his decision to stay silent about the accident until the next day, acknowledging that senior White House aides had "urged us to get the story out."
</S><S s_id="27">
He argued that, for the sake of accuracy, he wanted to wait until Whittington's condition was clear before contacting reporters.
</S><S s_id="28">
(Begin optional trim)
</S><S s_id="29">
Trevor Parry-Giles, a political communication specialist at the University of Maryland, said in choosing to speak to Fox, a network seen as more sympathetic to the administration than other news outlets, Cheney had chosen "a perfect venue" for him.
</S><S s_id="30">
But Parry-Giles added that the interview "will only fuel the suspicions that people already have about him, that he is unwilling to open himself to criticism."
</S><S s_id="31">
"I don't know that it will help him in terms of the public perception," Parry-Giles said.
</S><S s_id="32">
(End optional trim)
</S><S s_id="33">
Democrats and liberal groups criticized Cheney for limiting his remarks on the matter to one session with a network they called biased in his favor.
</S><S s_id="34">
Sen. Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat, noted that Cheney has not had a news conference to field questions from reporters in three and a half years.
</S><S s_id="35">
"He ought to have one to clear the air not only on this issue, but more importantly on the many other issues that have been shrouded by a veil of secrecy," Schumer said in a statement.
</S><S s_id="36">
Republicans rallied to Cheney's defense.
</S><S s_id="37">
"The constant second-guessing of what the vice president should have said and when he should have said it is an unnecessary diversion from the many issues facing our nation," said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham, R-S.C.
</S><S s_id="38">
Asked whether he would go hunting again in the future, Cheney, an avid outdoorsman, said, "I'll have to think about it."
</S><S s_id="39">
"The season is ending," he added.
</S><S s_id="40">
"I'm going to let some time pass over it and think about the future."

LAWYER SHOT BY CHENEY SUFFERS HEART ATTACK

LAWYER SHOT BY CHENEY SUFFERS HEART ATTACK
</S><S s_id="1">
WASHINGTON - An Austin lawyer accidentally shot by Vice President Cheney suffered a minor heart attack Tuesday as a result of birdshot in his heart, complicating a White House effort to steer attention away from the weekend hunting accident.
</S><S s_id="2">
One of the shotgun pellets that wounded Harry Whittington during a Saturday hunt at a South Texas ranch moved into his heart and caused the attack, said Dr. David Blanchard of Christus Spohn Hospital Corpus Christi-Memorial, where Whittington is being treated.
</S><S s_id="3">
Blanchard said Whittington is still expected to fully recover from being peppered with more than 100 birdshot pellets.
</S><S s_id="4">
At the White House, Press Secretary Scott McClellan, who patiently fielded more than 60 questions about the shooting on Monday, adopted a new tone on Tuesday as reporters pressed for answers.
</S><S s_id="5">
"We've got important work to do for the American people, and that's where we're going to keep our focus.
</S><S s_id="6">
You're welcome to continue to focus on these issues.
</S><S s_id="7">
I'm moving on," said McClellan, who learned about Whittington's heart attack shortly before the noon briefing but made no mention of it.
</S><S s_id="8">
Whittington's heart problem turned up during a routine evaluation of the 78-year-old patient.
</S><S s_id="9">
The heart attack resulted from an irregular heartbeat triggered by a single piece of birdshot that had moved into his heart.
</S><S s_id="10">
Blanchard said Whittington had no other symptoms or pain.
</S><S s_id="11">
"When birdshot is in your body there is always a risk it can move," he said.
</S><S s_id="12">
"His arteries are clear and he has the heart of a much younger individual."
</S><S s_id="13">
Doctors did a cardiac catheterization and moved Whittington back into intensive care.

Blanchard said the birdshot is lodged in position and does not pose additional danger.

"It was just a terrible, terrible accident," Peggy Puckett, one of Whittington's four daughters, said Tuesday.

"No one was at fault.

He feels bad for the vice president."

Asked if Whittington agreed with eyewitness accounts that said he was at fault for approaching Cheney while he was shooting, Puckett said her father "hasn't said anything like that."

At the White House, Cheney's office issued a statement on behalf of the vice president, who has yet to make a public comment about the shooting.

In it, Cheney aides said he was told Tuesday morning about Whittington's cardiac problem.

Cheney watched part of the Corpus Christi news conference concerning Whittington's condition.

McClellan's effort to divert attention from the shooting persisted throughout the Tuesday briefing.
</S><S s_id="29">
"We're moving on to the priorities of the American people.
</S><S s_id="30">
That's where our focus is," McClellan said.

Those priorities, he added, include "talking about how to make health care more affordable and accessible," a topic Bush is to address Wednesday in Dublin, Ohio.

McClellan fielded several more questions about the shooting, but added no new information - including no mention of the heart attack - and referred questions to Cheney's office.
</S><S s_id="33">
One of the questions referred to a shooting-related joke McClellan had told at an earlier briefing on Tuesday.
</S><S s_id="34">

"The orange they're wearing is not because they are concerned that the vice president may be there," McClellan said, a reference to the high-visibility orange worn by hunters as a safety precaution.

"Well, I think Mr. Whittington remains in our thoughts and prayers," McClellan said.

HUNTER SHOT BY CHENEY SUFFERS HEART ATTACK

HUNTER SHOT BY CHENEY SUFFERS HEART ATTACK
</S><S s_id="1">
The 78-year-old lawyer shot by Vice President Dick Cheney in a hunting accident over the weekend suffered a minor heart attack early Tuesday from birdshot lodged in his heart, hospital officials in Texas said.
</S><S s_id="2">
The lawyer, Harry Whittington, was moved back into the intensive care unit at Christus Spohn Hospital in Corpus Christi, Texas, to be monitored for up to a week in case the birdshot shifted or additional pellets in his body moved into other organs, the officials said at a televised news conference.
</S><S s_id="3">
Dr. David Blanchard, the emergency room chief, estimated that Whittington had more than five but "probably less than 150 to 200" pellets lodged in his body.
</S><S s_id="4">
Blanchard said that the hospital's cardiologists were optimistic that the pellet in Whittington's heart would not travel farther and that he would be able to function normally.
</S><S s_id="5">
They said they did not consider the other pellets in his body problematic.
</S><S s_id="6">
Cheney's office, in its first official announcement about the incident, released a statement shortly after 2:30 p.m.
</S><S s_id="7">
Eastern time saying that the vice president's "thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Whittington and his family" and that Cheney had spoken by telephone to Whittington an hour earlier.
</S><S s_id="8">
"The vice president wished Mr. Whittington well and asked if there was anything he needed," the statement said.
</S><S s_id="9">
"The vice president said that he stood ready to assist."
</S><S s_id="10">
The statement added that Whittington's spirits were "good," but "obviously his situation deserves the careful monitoring that his doctors are providing."
</S><S s_id="11">
The downturn in Whittington's health significantly changed the tone of the White House reaction to the hunting accident.
</S><S s_id="12">
In Texas, Carlos Valdez, the district attorney in Kleberg County, said a fatality would immediately spur a new report from the local sheriff and, most likely, a grand jury investigation.
</S><S s_id="13">
Cheney's aides said he first learned of the change in Whittington's condition when he arrived at his West Wing office about 7:40 a.m. on Tuesday, shortly after doctors in Corpus Christi said that they had picked up an irregular heartbeat from Whittington during their morning rounds.
</S><S s_id="14">
Doctors said that the pellet, which they had known since the accident was near Whittington's heart, had evidently moved into the heart muscle, causing "some quivering" called atrial fibrillation.
</S><S s_id="15">
Whittington, who had been shot by Cheney on Saturday and moved out of intensive care on Monday, was immediately put back into intensive care.

HANDLING OF ACCIDENT CAUSING TENSION BETWEEN WHITE HOUSE STAFFS

HANDLING OF ACCIDENT CAUSING TENSION BETWEEN WHITE HOUSE STAFFS
</S><S s_id="1">
When the White House press secretary, Scott McClellan, entered the press room Tuesday morning and suggested he was wearing an orange tie to avoid a stray shot from Vice President Dick Cheney, it seemed to signal an effort to defuse the accidental-shooting story with a laugh.
</S><S s_id="2">
But by midday, it was clear that the staffs of the president and the vice president had failed to communicate.
</S><S s_id="3">
Just after arriving at work around 7:45 a.m., Cheney learned that the man he shot, Harry Whittington, was about to undergo a heart procedure because his injuries were more serious than earlier believed, Cheney's spokeswoman said.
</S><S s_id="4">
No one in Cheney's office passed the word to McClellan, senior officials at the White House said, adding that the press secretary never would have joked about the shooting accident if he had known about the turn of events involving Whittington.
</S><S s_id="5">
It was the latest example of the degree to which Cheney's habit of living in his own world in the Bush White House -- surrounded by his own staff, relying on his own instincts, saying as little as possible -- had backfired since the accident in Texas on Saturday.
</S><S s_id="6">
Cheney's staff members have kept their comments to chronological details and to repeating Cheney's written statements.
</S><S s_id="7">
The tension between President Bush's staff and Cheney's has been palpable, with White House officials whispering to reporters about how they tried to handle the news of the shooting differently.
</S><S s_id="8">
McClellan, while being careful not to cross Cheney or his aides directly, has made a point of reminding reporters of how he dealt with Bush's bicycle accident last summer, when the president collided with a policeman at the G-8 summit.
</S><S s_id="9">
"I immediately briefed the press on how the accident had happened, and the condition of the police officer," who was taken to the hospital with minor injuries, McClellan said.
</S><S s_id="10">
His message was clear: There was a procedure for conveying this kind of news, and it was not followed in this case.
</S><S s_id="11">
Several White House officials said no one among the White House staff, including the chief of staff, Andrew H. Card, felt empowered to dictate how news of the shooting accident would be handled.
</S><S s_id="12">
Presumably the Bush himself could have declared how the news would be disseminated, something he does often on policy matters.
</S><S s_id="13">
Until this week, the periodic disconnect between Cheney's office and the rest of the White House has been the source of grumbling, but rarely open tension.

ACCOUNT OF DOCTORS RAISES QUESTIONS ON HEART INJURY

ACCOUNT OF DOCTORS RAISES QUESTIONS ON HEART INJURY
</S><S s_id="1">
The account given Tuesday by doctors caring for the Texas lawyer accidentally shot by Vice President Dick Cheney last weekend raises serious questions about how and when a pellet entered his heart and what tests were done to establish where the pellet was lodged, doctors not connected with his case said.
</S><S s_id="2">
Although the public was told for the first time on Tuesday that a shotgun pellet from a hunting accident had lodged in the lawyer's heart, one of his doctors said that "we knew that he had some birdshot very close to the heart from the get-go," but not its precise location.
</S><S s_id="3">
Such evidence would have come from standard chest X-rays and a CT scan if one was performed shortly after his admission to a hospital in Corpus Christi, Texas.
</S><S s_id="4">
Earlier accounts described as minor the pellet wounds that the lawyer, Harry M. Whittington, suffered in the face, neck, chest and ribs.
</S><S s_id="5">
Cheney sprayed Whittington, 78, with six to 200 pieces of birdshot, the doctors said Tuesday.
</S><S s_id="6">
One pellet apparently moved to damage his heart, causing two problems: an abnormal heart rhythm, atrial fibrillation, and a minor heart attack that were detected early Tuesday morning, the doctors said in a news conference at Christus Spohn Hospital in Corpus Christi.
</S><S s_id="7">
Their account left open the source of the birdshot that migrated to the heart and how it got there.
</S><S s_id="8">
Dr. O. Wayne Isom, the chairman of heart and chest surgery at Weill Cornell Medical College, said it was unlikely that a pellet would migrate to the heart through the bloodstream, as some have assumed from the account of the Texas doctors.
</S><S s_id="9">
The reason, Isom said, is that the pellet would have to enter a vein, travel to and through the lung vessels that go to the heart, and then lodge in heart tissue, not in one of its chambers.
</S><S s_id="10">
The pellets were approximately 5 millimeters, about the size of a BB, and larger than most blood vessels, said Dr. David Blanchard, director of emergency services at the hospital.
</S><S s_id="11">
A more likely explanation, Isom said, is that the pellet lodged in or touched the heart when Whittington was shot.
</S><S s_id="12">
Doctors use different X-ray techniques to determine the position of a pellet in the heart.
</S><S s_id="13">
But the account of the Texas doctors was unclear regarding which ones they performed and when.
</S><S s_id="14">
Dr. Peter Banko, the Texas hospital's emergency department medical director, said doctors there did an ultrasound, a CT scan and a cardiac catheterization, which provide two-dimensional images.
</S><S s_id="15">
Banko said the hospital had a 64-slice CT scan that could provide three-dimensional images, but he did not say that the doctors performed the more sophisticated one on Whittington, or if so, when.
</S><S s_id="16">
Doctors try to synchronize such CT X-rays with the heartbeat to avoid blurring from motion, said Dr. Jeffrey P. Goldman, a specialist in heart CT scans at Manhattan Diagnostic Radiology.
</S><S s_id="17">
But, Goldman said, doctors cannot synchronize a CT scan in patients with atrial fibrillation.
</S><S s_id="18">
Metal in a pellet can cause a different kind of blurring in CT scans.
</S><S s_id="19">
But the Texas doctors did not say that they performed a 64-slice CT scan after they learned Whittington had a pellet near his heart and before he developed the abnormal heart rhythm.
</S><S s_id="20">
Goldman said that "until you do the test you don't know how much blurring there is."
</S><S s_id="21">
Isom said patients could develop atrial fibrillation two to three days after stitches were placed in a heart or it was injured.
</S><S s_id="22">
The Texas doctors did not say how they determined that Whittington had had a heart attack.
</S><S s_id="23">
Two standard tests are from electrocardiograms and measuring enzymes.
</S><S s_id="24">
But injuries to the heart can cause a rise in enzymes that may not necessarily represent a heart attack.
</S><S s_id="25">
The Texas doctors and the White House doctors with whom they discussed Whittington's case did not respond to a request for interviews.

Cheney cleared in hunting accident: report
</S><S s_id="1">
A Texas sheriff's office has cleared U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney of any wrongdoing in a shooting accident at a ranch in the state Saturday, the USA Today newspaper reported Tuesday.
</S><S s_id="2">
Cheney accidentally shot fellow hunter Harry Whittington while they were hunting quail at the Armstrong Ranch, in southern Texas.
</S><S s_id="3">
The Kenedy County Sheriff's Office near the ranch interviewed both men after the Secret Service called to notify them shortly after the shooting, the report said.
</S><S s_id="4">
The sheriff's office said investigation revealed that there was no alcohol or misconduct involved in the incident, which "was no more than a hunting accident."
</S><S s_id="5">
Cheney did violate one small legal requirement, the report said.
</S><S s_id="6">
Cheney's office said Monday that while Cheney had a 125-U.S. dollar non-resident Texas hunting license, he lacked a required 7-dollar stamp to hunt upland game birds such as quail.
</S><S s_id="7">
In a statement, his office said Cheney has mailed a 7-dollar check for the stamp.
</S><S s_id="8">
The White House worked on Monday to explain why it took almost 20 hours for the public to first learn of the accident.
</S><S s_id="9">
"The first priority was making sure that Harry Whittington, Mr. Whittington, was getting the medical care that he needed," White House spokesman Scott McClellan said.
</S><S s_id="10">
President George W. Bush and White House deputy chief of staff Karl Rove were told of the shooting Saturday night but deferred to Cheney on providing information to the public, a report in Tuesday's The Washington Post said.
</S><S s_id="11">
The Post report said even some White House officials thought Cheney mishandled the responses and opened the administration to criticism that it was withholding important public information.
</S><S s_id="12">
Whittington, 78, an Austin lawyer and longtime Republican activist, was in stable condition at Christus Spohn Hospital-Memorial in Corpus Christi, Texas, news reports said.
