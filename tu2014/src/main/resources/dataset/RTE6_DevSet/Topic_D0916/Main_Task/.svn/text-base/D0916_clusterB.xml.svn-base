Six Iraqi women detainees to be released soon
</S><S s_id="1">
Six Iraqi women detainees are to be freed soon following a review of their case, a justice ministry official said Wednesday, as the captors of a US woman journalist demanded all female prisoners be freed.
</S><S s_id="2">
"The decision has been taken and these detainees will be released in the coming days," according to the official who declined to be named.
</S><S s_id="3">
US forces had earlier said they were holding a total of eight Iraqi women detainees because they presented "an imperative threat to the security of Iraq.
</S><S s_id="4">
"All detainees have their cases reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether conditions still warrant their internment as security threats," the military added.
</S><S s_id="5">
On Tuesday, Al-Jazeera television showed a videotape of Jill Carroll taken by her kidnappers, who issued an execution ultimatum saying the US reporter would be executed within 72 hours if Iraqi women detainees were not set free.
</S><S s_id="6">
The justice minister had asked in the past for the commission reviewing the cases of detainees to speed up its work on the women, the ministry official said.
</S><S s_id="7">
"We asked that they either be charged or freed, and no proof has been found to implicate them in acts of violence," the official said.
</S><S s_id="8">
The commission is comprised of representatives of the justice, interior and human rights ministries, and members of the US-led military coalition.
</S><S s_id="9">
Carroll, 28, who works for the Boston-based Christian Science Monitor newspaper, was seized on a Baghdad street on January 7 by gunmen who shot dead her interpretor.
</S><S s_id="10">
More than 12,000 Iraqis are currently detained by coalition forces.

US Islamic group sends team to Iraq seeking release of journalist
</S><S s_id="1">
A leading US-based Islamic rights group on Wednesday announced it was sending representatives to Baghdad seeking the release of Jill Carroll, the US journalist abducted in Iraq.
</S><S s_id="2">
Carroll's captors have threatened to kill her unless the United States freed all female prisoners in Iraq within 72 hours.
</S><S s_id="3">
On Tuesday, the Qatar-based Arabic television station Al-Jazeera showed a videotape of Carroll taken by her kidnappers, who issued their execution ultimatum.
</S><S s_id="4">
The Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) said in a statement that because of the short deadline its delegation will hold a press conference late Thursday in Amman "to make a public appeal to the kidnappers for Carroll's freedom."
</S><S s_id="5">
CAIR also plans a press conference in Carroll's home state of Michigan with local Muslim leaders to call for her release.
</S><S s_id="6">
The group plans a second press conference in Baghdad on Friday, the statement added.
</S><S s_id="7">
CAIR earlier issued a statement -- translated into Arabic and distributed to Middle Eastern media outlets -- calling for Carroll's "immediate and unconditional" release.

Carroll, 28, arrived in Iraq in 2003 and has been filing stories for the Christian Science Monitor newspaper since early last year.

Mother of US journalist abducted in Iraq pleads for her safe 
return
ATTENTION - ADDS fresh appeals for Carroll's release ///
</S><S s_id="1">
The mother of a US journalist abducted in Iraq made an impassioned plea for her release Thursday as the clock ran down on a threat by the kidnappers to execute her daughter.
</S><S s_id="2">
Mary Beth Carroll said a video of her daughter Jill taken by her captors had given the family hope that she was still alive, though it "has also shaken us about her fate."
</S><S s_id="3">
Jill Carroll was seized by gunmen in Baghdad on January 7.
</S><S s_id="4">
They have threatened to kill her on Friday unless all Iraqi women in US military custody are released.
</S><S s_id="5">
"I, her father and her sister are appealing directly to her captors to release this young woman, who has worked so hard to show the suffering of Iraqis," Carroll's mother said, reading the family's prepared statement on CNN television.
</S><S s_id="6">
"Taking vengeance on my innocent daughter, who loved Iraq and its people, will not create justice.
</S><S s_id="7">
To her captors, I say that Jill's welfare depends upon you, and so we call upon you to ensure that Jill is returned safely home to her family, who needs her and loves her."
</S><S s_id="8">
Carroll also pleaded with the captors to "work with Jill to find a way to contact us with the honorable intent of discussing her release."
</S><S s_id="9">
On the video broadcast Tuesday by the Al-Jazeera Arabic television station, the 28-year-old freelance reporter, wearing a grey sweatshirt, with her long brown hair loose, was shown alone and speaking, but there was no sound.
</S><S s_id="10">
It was the first time she had been seen since her disappearance.
</S><S s_id="11">
In Iraq on Wednesday, a justice ministry official said that six Iraqi women detainees were to be freed in the coming days.
</S><S s_id="12">
US forces had earlier said they were holding eight Iraqi women because they presented "an imperative threat" to the security of Iraq.
</S><S s_id="13">
Jill Carroll arrived in Iraq in 2003 and worked for a variety of news organisations from several different countries.
</S><S s_id="14">
She began filing stories for the Christian Science Monitor, her current newspaper, early last year.
</S><S s_id="15">
Her mother told CNN that Jill had traveled to the region to get a sense of the terrain and the culture ahead of the war.
</S><S s_id="16">
"We could see the war was coming in Iraq, and she didn't want to be a parachute journalist, somebody who just comes in ... quickly.
</S><S s_id="17">
She wanted to get to the Middle East early, learn about the people of Iraq, learn about the culture and the customs and the politics, so she could report well and accurately."
</S><S s_id="18">
She said they had also discussed the possibility of her being kidnapped.
</S><S s_id="19">
"I told her frankly how I felt if she would be kidnapped, and supporting her and knowing that she was doing what she loved and what she thought was very important to do, and that that would give me and her family comfort at this time -- and it does," Mary Beth Carroll told CNN.
</S><S s_id="20">
She added: "I think she was a wonderful ambassador, is a wonderful ambassador, to the United States" for the Iraqi people.
</S><S s_id="21">
"We know she's a strong woman and that her strength of character and her mind will get her through this," she said.
</S><S s_id="22">
The Islamic Party, Iraq's main Sunni Arab party, called Thursday for Carroll to be released "as quickly as possible" and condemned "the abduction of innocent people."
</S><S s_id="23">
A similar appeal came from the Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations, which said it was sending a delegation to Baghdad to make a public plea for Carroll's release.
</S><S s_id="24">
"No cause can be served by harming those who only seek to convey the human suffering caused by war," the organisation said in a statement.
</S><S s_id="25">
According to the media watchdog Reporters Without Borders, Carroll is the 35th media worker to be kidnapped in Iraq since the start of the war.
</S><S s_id="26">
Five of the kidnapping victims -- four Iraqis and Enzo Baldoni of Italy -- were killed by their abductors.
</S><S s_id="27">
The others were all released safe and sound.

Release of Iraqi female detainees not imminent: Pentagon
</S><S s_id="1">
The Pentagon said Thursday the release of female detainees from US military-run facilities in Iraq is not imminent despite threats by kidnappers to kill an American journalist held hostage.
</S><S s_id="2">
Kidnappers on Tuesday threatened to kill 28-year-old freelance reporter Jill Carroll if the United States failed to meet a 72-hour deadline to free all female prisoners.
</S><S s_id="3">
"I don't have any information on any imminent releases," said Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman.
</S><S s_id="4">
Iraq's justice ministry said Wednesday that six of eight women detainees held by US forces would be released within days, but it denied there was any link with the kidnappers' demands.
</S><S s_id="5">
"I have no insight on that," Whitman said.
</S><S s_id="6">
He said fewer than 10 Iraqi women were held in facilities run by the US military in Iraq.
</S><S s_id="7">
He said Iraqi-US review boards periodically assess whether prisoners, male or female, no longer pose a threat and should be released.
</S><S s_id="8">
In Baghdad, a US military spokesman said some female detainees may be released "in accordance with the normal process."
</S><S s_id="9">
"But they won't be released as a response to a demand by terrorists and criminal agents," said Brigadier General Donald Alston.

</S><S s_id="2">

"Every single effort possible that can be made is being made to try to locate her, to try to find out what is going on ... to try to deal with this issue," Kerry said, as the clock ran down on a threat by kidnappers to execute Carroll.

American Islamic group heads to Middle East to plead for journalist's release

The Council on American-Islamic Relations is planning to hold one news conference Thursday in Amman, Jordan, and another Friday in Baghdad.

The group hopes to reach Arab television audiences and convince the captors of Jill Carroll, a freelancer for the Boston-based Christian Science Monitor, to release her.
</S><S s_id="4">
"We're taking a serious step on behalf of our community, and we are hopeful that our words will be heard and our appeal will be listened to," said Nihad Awad, executive director of CAIR.

"We have been reading about her work ... and though we don't know her, we know it is wrong to kidnap people and hurt innocent people."
</S><S s_id="6">
Carroll, 28, was kidnapped Jan. 7 in one of Baghdad's most dangerous neighborhoods.

Calls intensify for release of kidnapped U.S. reporter as Iraq says U.S. is set to free Iraqi female detainees

Calls intensify for release of kidnapped U.S. reporter as Iraq says U.S. is set to free Iraqi female detainees
</S><S s_id="1">
Muslim leaders and her pleading mother appealed Thursday for the release of kidnapped American journalist Jill Carroll as Iraqi officials said six detained Iraqi women were due for release by the U.S. military, a condition set by the hostage-takers who are threatening to kill their captive.
</S><S s_id="2">
But the White House said no prisoner release appeared imminent and a major Sunni Arab clerical group said it could do little to help win Carroll's freedom because it did not know who was holding her.
</S><S s_id="3">
The kidnappers of 28-year-old Carroll, identified as the previously unknown "Revenge Brigade," have given until Friday evening for all Iraqi female detainees to be freed or they would execute her.
</S><S s_id="4">
However, Iraqi kidnap groups often set such deadlines only to ignore them and continue holding captives.
</S><S s_id="5">
New images showing Carroll surrounded by three armed and masked gunmen were aired Thursday by the Arab TV station Al-Jazeera.
</S><S s_id="6">
The 20 seconds of silent footage were from a tape of which excerpts were broadcast Tuesday with the 72-hour deadline.
</S><S s_id="7">
Carroll's mother said the video images gave her hope that her daughter is alive but also have "shaken us about her fate."
</S><S s_id="8">
"I, her father and her sister are appealing directly to her captors to release this young woman who has worked so hard to show the sufferings of Iraqis to the world," Mary Beth Carroll told CNN's "American Morning."
</S><S s_id="9">
Iraq's deputy justice minister, Busho Ibrahim Ali, said six of the eight Iraqi women in custody are expected to be released next week, but he stressed that any release would "not be part of any swap with any kidnappers."
</S><S s_id="10">
"I insisted that the Americans should bring (the women's) files and release them and they will be freed next week along with other detainees," Ali told Associated Press Television News.
</S><S s_id="11">
He did not elaborate on who the other detainees were, but said the recommendation to free the women was made Monday.
</S><S s_id="12">
Speculation that the Iraqi women may soon be freed raised hopes for the release of Carroll, a freelance journalist who was working for the Christian Science Monitor when she was seized Jan. 7 in western Baghdad.
</S><S s_id="13">
Her translator was killed.
</S><S s_id="14">
U.S. military officials repeatedly refused Thursday to confirm whether any release was imminent.
</S><S s_id="15">
In Washington, White House press secretary Scott McClellan said the Bush administration was working hard to secure Carroll's freedom but said no Iraqi detainees were expected to be released soon, citing information from the U.S. Department of Defense.
</S><S s_id="16">
"Any time you have an American held hostage, wherever they are, they are a priority for the administration," McClellan said Thursday.
</S><S s_id="17">
"And we want to see her safe return.
</S><S s_id="18">
As I indicated yesterday, too, I don't think it's really helpful to go beyond that at this point."
</S><S s_id="19">
Carroll grew up in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and received an journalism undergraduate degree in 1999 from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst.
</S><S s_id="20">
She worked as a reporting assistant for The Wall Street Journal before moving to Jordan and launching her freelance career in 2002, learning Arabic on the way.
</S><S s_id="21">
Her newspaper's Washington bureau chief, David Cook, also urged the captors to contact them to discuss her release.
</S><S s_id="22">
Cook would not say specifically if the newspaper would pay ransom.
</S><S s_id="23">
"I think our policy would be that we would welcome contact from the captors," Cook told NBC.
</S><S s_id="24">
"Either the family or the Monitor would be eager to talk to the captors."
</S><S s_id="25">
Calls for Carroll's freedom were also made by Muslim leaders in Iraq plus a team of U.S.-based Islamic advocates traveling to the Middle East to seek her release.
</S><S s_id="26">
The Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations flew to the Jordanian capital, Amman, on Thursday and was planning to hold a news conference Friday in Baghdad.
</S><S s_id="27">
The group said it hopes to reach Arab television audiences and persuade Carroll's captors to release her.
</S><S s_id="28">
The Bloomfield Hills-based Islamic Shura Council of Michigan, which represents about 20 Muslim groups in the state, told the Detroit Free Press that Carroll's kidnapping would not help the Iraqi cause.
</S><S s_id="29">
In Iraq, leaders of three prominent Sunni Muslim groups demanded Carroll's release.
</S><S s_id="30">
Iraq's insurgency draws the bulk of its support from Iraq's once dominant Sunni Arab community, which fell from grace once its Sunni benefactor, Saddam, was toppled.
</S><S s_id="31">
"We condemn the abduction of journalists who are a means to convey the truth to the people," said Muthana Harith al-Dhari, spokesman for the Association of Muslim Scholars, which is believed to have ties to some Sunni insurgent groups.
</S><S s_id="32">
However, al-Dhari, who is considered a hard-liner in the association, said there was little that his group could do because it did not know who was holding her.
</S><S s_id="33">
French journalist and former hostage Florence Aubenas, who was released in June after being held hostage in Iraq for 157 days, also called on Carroll's hostage-takers to release her.
</S><S s_id="34">
"She came to this country to do her job as a journalist and not anything else," Aubenas told Al-Jazeera.
</S><S s_id="35">
Carroll's mother said her daughter even discussed with her family the possibility of being kidnapped in Iraq, a country where more than 240 foreigners have been kidnapped and at least 39 killed since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein.
</S><S s_id="36">
"Those things have been said.
</S><S s_id="37">
And she knows that we love her and support her," Mary Beth Carroll said on CNN.
</S><S s_id="38">
"She knows that we can be strong for her."

JILL CARROLL'S BRAVERY BOSTON GLOBE

JILL CARROLL'S BRAVERY BOSTON GLOBE
</S><S s_id="1">
JILL CARROLL'S BRAVERY TO A WORLD increasingly suffused with media, the kidnapping of Jill Carroll in Baghdad is a reminder of the dangers that journalists face in the most dangerous war zone on earth and of the importance of foreign correspondents in explaining distant places to Americans.
</S><S s_id="2">
Iraqi gangs, which seize foreigners because they are easy targets, harm their country by restricting the flow of information to the rest of the world.
</S><S s_id="3">
By all accounts Carroll, a freelance writer on assignment for The Christian Science Monitor, has felt a deep sympathy for Iraqis.
</S><S s_id="4">
She was learning Arabic, liked the food, and moved about with minimal protection.
</S><S s_id="5">
She was visiting a dangerous neighborhood in Baghdad on Jan. 7 to interview an Iraqi politician when her translator was killed and she was kidnapped.
</S><S s_id="6">
Somebody with her sensibilities, willing to take risks, is just the kind of reporter that is needed to explain the turbulence in Iraq to Americans.
</S><S s_id="7">
It is no surprise that the abduction has been denounced by many Iraqis.
</S><S s_id="8">
Even some among the Sunni community, where opposition to the US invasion is highest, have come out against the kidnapping.
</S><S s_id="9">
"We condemn the abduction of journalists, who are means to conveying the truth to people," Muthana Harith al-Dhari, a spokesman for the Association of Muslim Scholars, said.
</S><S s_id="10">
Accurate information about Iraq is of vital importance to Americans as they consider how long US troops should stay there.
</S><S s_id="11">
The Iraqi perspective is best obtained from reporters with a toe in both cultures.
</S><S s_id="12">
Beginning with the US invasion in 2003, 60 journalists have been killed in Iraq, making it by far the most dangerous place on earth to be a reporter.
</S><S s_id="13">
One of them was Elizabeth Neuffer, foreign correspondent for the Globe, who died in an auto accident in the early stages of the conflict.
</S><S s_id="14">
The danger has worsened as journalists have become targets by design instead of happenstance.
</S><S s_id="15">
The Committee to Protect Journalists reports that most of the dead are Iraqi, doing their best to find the news in a society riven with violence.
</S><S s_id="16">
The latest casualties reported on the committee website were Mohammed Haroon, a journalist once affiliated with the Saddam Hussein regime, and Firas Maadidi and Hind Ismail, reporters for a prodemocracy newspaper.
</S><S s_id="17">
These journalists, had they lived, would have provided information and shaped opinions that could have promoted peaceful change in Iraq.
</S><S s_id="18">
The men who abducted Carroll apparently have a different purpose - to sow fear among news people.
</S><S s_id="19">
Doing journalism in Iraq is a tough, exhausting, and dangerous craft.
</S><S s_id="20">
Not to do it, however, would leave communication about the struggle of its people to the gunmen and suicide bombers.
