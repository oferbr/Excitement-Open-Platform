Irish government hopes for long-awaited IRA response this week
by Andrew Bushe
</S><S s_id="1">
Hopes Northern Ireland's Irish Republican Army will make a long-awaited statement committing itself to democratic means were raised Tuesday as Ireland's deputy prime minister said she expected news later this week.
</S><S s_id="2">
Mary Harney, leader of the Progressive Democrat Party, the junior partner in Prime Minister Bertie Ahern's ruling coalition, said she hoped the IRA statement would see an end to "criminality in Ireland in all its forms once and for all".
</S><S s_id="3">
In April, Gerry Adams, the leader of the political wing of the IRA, Sinn Fein, made a direct appeal to the Roman Catholic paramilitary group to embrace purely political and democratic activity.
</S><S s_id="4">
The Irish and British governments had been hoping for a response to the call at some point during the summer.
</S><S s_id="5">
"I certainly hope it (the statement) will be substantial," Harney told Ireland's RTE state radio.
</S><S s_id="6">
"There have been many false dawns.
</S><S s_id="7">
I hope on this occasion that it is not a false dawn and that we can put the muddy past of paramilitarism totally and utterly behind us, and that everybody embraces politics and all that that involves -- peaceful politics and democratic politics."
</S><S s_id="8">
The IRA, which declared a ceasefire in its campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland before the 1998 Good Friday peace deal that largely ended 30 years of violence, has been holding consultations with members.
</S><S s_id="9">
The Irish media has reported that three senior Sinn Fein leaders, including Adams and chief negotiator Martin McGuinness, have stepped down from their posts on the seven-man ruling body of the IRA.
</S><S s_id="10">
In an unprecedented charge in January, Irish Justice Minister Michael McDowell claimed the trio were leaders of both the political and military wings of the movement.
</S><S s_id="11">
However, in a joint statement the Sinn Fein leaders "categorically" denied they were members of the outlawed IRA's ruling body, and accused McDowell of abusing his office.
</S><S s_id="12">
Even if the IRA commits itself to ending violence, Northern Ireland could still be bogged down by the sort of factional bickering which saw a solution to the current political deadlock scuppered just before Christmas.
</S><S s_id="13">
Protestant factions in Northern Ireland, particularly the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) led by veteran hardliner Ian Paisley, are adamant that there can be no lasting settlement without a move by the IRA to end all paramilitary and criminal activity and to decommission its weapons.
</S><S s_id="14">
The Good Friday agreement paved the way for a Protestant-Catholic power-sharing assembly in Belfast, but that was suspended more than two years ago amid allegations of IRA espionage.
</S><S s_id="15">
Hopes of a new political settlement were dashed in December when moves to destroy IRA arms caches were halted following Protestant demands the process be photographed, something Sinn Fein rejected as an unnecessary humiliation.

Adams confirms 'challenging' IRA statement due soon
</S><S s_id="1">
Gerry Adams, the leader of the Sinn Fein political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), confirmed Thursday that the Roman Catholic paramilitary group was on the verge of making a significant statement.
</S><S s_id="2">
"The forthcoming IRA statement will challenge Irish Republicans (Sinn Fein) and nationalists (other Catholics).
</S><S s_id="3">
I appeal to everyone to carefully read what the army has to say and to remain united and steadfast," he said.
</S><S s_id="4">
"The IRA statement will also challenge others, especially the two governments and the (Protestant) Unionists," Adams said in a statement distributed by Sinn Fein in the Irish capital of Dublin.
</S><S s_id="5">
"The Dublin political establishment in particular will have a lot of soul searching to do, if those in the political leadership are to meet the needs of the upcoming period," Adams said, without elaborating.
</S><S s_id="6">
The underground guerrilla movement which has been fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland for 30 years is expected to respond to British-Irish calls for it to renounce violence once and for all.
</S><S s_id="7">
The appeal was reinforced on April 6 when Adams urged the IRA to take the "historic" decision to abandon the armed struggle and engage in a political process for peace in Northern Ireland.

Senior figures in Sinn Fein fly to United States ahead of expected IRA peace declaration
</S><S s_id="1">
Senior figures in Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican Army-linked party, departed Wednesday for the United States ahead of an expected major new peace declaration from the outlawed IRA.
</S><S s_id="2">
The British, Irish and U.S. governments have been pressing since December for the IRA to disarm fully and disband in support of Northern Ireland's 1998 peace accord.
</S><S s_id="3">
The pact's key goal _ a joint Catholic-Protestant administration for the British territory _ has been hold since 2002 because of Protestant refusal to cooperate with Sinn Fein, the major Catholic-backed party.
</S><S s_id="4">
The British and Irish governments both expect the IRA to release a new policy statement soon, perhaps on Thursday, outlining its future intentions.
</S><S s_id="5">
Both governments insist the IRA must disarm fully and renounce violence and criminal activity _ commitments the IRA has refused to give in the past.
</S><S s_id="6">
Sinn Fein deputy leader Martin McGuinness and the party's North American representative, Rita O'Hare, were planning to meet supporters in the U.S. Congress and President George W. Bush's envoy to Northern Ireland, Mitchell Reiss.
</S><S s_id="7">
In a sign of recent U.S. pressure on the Sinn Fein-IRA movement, O'Hare in February was barred from traveling into the United States _ the first time that happened since she became Sinn Fein's senior U.S.-based lobbyist in 1998.
</S><S s_id="8">
O'Hare has been on the run from British justice since the early 1970s in Northern Ireland, where she absconded on bail while awaiting trial on charge of attempting to murder British soldiers.

IRA SAID TO RENOUNCE VIOLENCE IN FAVOR OF POLITICAL STRUGGLE

IRA SAID TO RENOUNCE VIOLENCE IN FAVOR OF POLITICAL STRUGGLE
</S><S s_id="1">
The Irish Republican Army has renounced its armed struggle for a united Ireland, agreeing to turn solely to political methods, an American businessman said Tuesday after being briefed on a statement expected from the guerrilla group later this week.
</S><S s_id="2">
The agreement, if borne out, would be a historic turning point in the violent history of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
</S><S s_id="3">
But there is still widespread official skepticism about IRA promises, particularly when it comes to the issue of disarmament.
</S><S s_id="4">
Indeed, it was not immediately clear whether the IRA would address how several tons of arms, hidden in bunkers across Ireland, would be disposed of, according to the businessman, Niall O'Dowd, who brokered talks between the IRA and American officials that helped lead to a cease-fire in 1994.
</S><S s_id="5">
The continued existence of those weapons, which were to have been destroyed under an agreement reached after the cease-fire, contributed to the collapse of the Northern Ireland government in 2003.
</S><S s_id="6">
On Tuesday night, an Irish government spokesman said an IRA commitment to nonviolence had to be backed by an unambiguous process for disposing of all its weapons.
</S><S s_id="7">
"The ultimate test is the delivery on that," said the spokesman, who as a matter of routine practice spoke only on the condition that he not be identified.
</S><S s_id="8">
A spokesman for the British government declined comment.
</S><S s_id="9">
A number of recent signs have pointed to major developments occurring within the IRA.
</S><S s_id="10">
On Tuesday, Ireland's justice minister, Michael McDowell, said the top leaders of the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, including Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, had stepped down from positions on the IRA's secretive governing council.
</S><S s_id="11">
In addition, Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland was cutting short a vacation to return to Dublin later this week.
</S><S s_id="12">
John DeChastelain, a Canadian general who is the chairman of a commission set up to oversee the destruction of paramilitary weapons, is in Ireland this week, the Irish government spokesman said.
</S><S s_id="13">
And McGuinness is to go to Washington on Thursday to brief American officials on the peace process, according to Rita O'Hare, Sinn Fein's representative in the United States.
</S><S s_id="14">
The developments follow a public appeal by Adams in April, in which he urged the republican movement to turn away from violent struggle and to devote all its energies to politics.
</S><S s_id="15">
Adams said he had justified the IRA's activities in the past because no alternative existed for people who did not wish to submit to British authority.
</S><S s_id="16">
"That struggle can now be taken forward by other means," Adams said in a speech in Belfast.
</S><S s_id="17">
He asked, "Can you take courageous initiatives which will achieve your aims by purely political and democratic activity?"
</S><S s_id="18">
O'Dowd, the publisher of a magazine, Irish America, and a newspaper, Irish Voice, said Adams and other senior republicans had persuaded the IRA membership that it could succeed politically.
</S><S s_id="19">
Sinn Fein is now the second-largest party in Northern Ireland, and it has made significant gains among voters in the Republic of Ireland since 1994.
</S><S s_id="20">
"This is a truly historic moment in Irish history," O'Dowd said.
</S><S s_id="21">
"It is the first time since the founding of the Irish state that the IRA has agreed that there should be no armed struggle.
</S><S s_id="22">
Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness have taken an armed revolutionary movement and succeeded in placing it on a political path.
</S><S s_id="23">
Irish history is littered with people such as Michael Collins, who tried to do the same and failed."
</S><S s_id="24">
However, the IRA's failure to disarm since 1994 has created much official skepticism about its motives and statements.
</S><S s_id="25">
"There is no position whatsoever between being armed and being unarmed for the IRA," said McDowell, the justice minister.
</S><S s_id="26">
"If the IRA are decommissioning, they must decommission all their weapons in their entirety, every single pistol, every single bullet, the lot."

IRA RENOUNCES VIOLENCE IN POTENTIALLY PROFOUND SHIFT

IRA RENOUNCES VIOLENCE IN POTENTIALLY PROFOUND SHIFT
</S><S s_id="1">
The Irish Republican Army declared an end to its campaign of violence against Britain that claimed more than 3,500 lives over 36 years, saying there was "an alternative way to achieve" its goal of a United Ireland.
</S><S s_id="2">
The announcement in a DVD released to reporters was taken in London as, potentially, a profound shift in Northern Ireland's destiny, reversing decades of Republican commitment to violence in the effort to end British rule."This may be the day on which, finally, after all these false dawns and dashed hopes, peace replaced war, politics replaces terror on the island of Ireland," Prime Minister Tony Blair said in a televised statement in London.
</S><S s_id="3">
He also said the announcement "creates the circumstances" in which Northern Ireland's power-sharing local government could be revived.
</S><S s_id="4">
"This is a step of unparalleled magnitude in the recent history of Northern Ireland."
</S><S s_id="5">
The Irish Prime Minister, Bertie Aherne, struck a more cautious note, saying the IRA statement would be momentous if the organization matched words with deeds.
</S><S s_id="6">
Among the troubling issues is whether the IRA will halt the criminal operations -- such as armed robbery, smuggling and money laundering -- that fund the organization.
</S><S s_id="7">
The IRA said that its members must not engage in any other activities whatsoever, but skeptics worry that the organization may break up into small independent crime gangs.
</S><S s_id="8">
The statement by the IRA said: "Our decisions have been taken to advance our republican and democratic objectives, including our goal of a united Ireland.
</S><S s_id="9">
We believe there is now an alternative way to achieve this and to end British rule in our country."
</S><S s_id="10">
"All IRA units have been ordered to dump arms," said the statement, which was read out on a DVD by a former prisoner, Seana Walsh.
</S><S s_id="11">
Blair said Unionists -- the IRA's foes -- would want to ensure that the "clear statement of principal is kept to in practice."
</S><S s_id="12">
The widely expected statement could mark the conclusion of the bloodiest chapter in modern Irish history, foretold in 1994, when an IRA cease-fire began winding up the tradition of militant Irish republicanism.
</S><S s_id="13">
And it takes a step towards restoring Northern Ireland's local government, which was established under a 1998 peace accord but suspended in 2002 due to allegations of IRA activity.Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, said at a news conference in Dublin that the announcement could "help revive the peace process" and said it was a challenge to the British and Irish governments as well as the Ulster Unionists to see that the peace accord is carried out.
</S><S s_id="14">
Unionists, the province's largest political group who are mostly Protestant, are likely to insist on a delay of at least a year before returning to share seats in the provincial legislature with Sinn Fein.
</S><S s_id="15">
"There are still a number of areas of loose ends," Jeffrey Donaldson, a Northern Irish member of the British parliament for the hard-line Democratic Unionists, told RTE radio.
</S><S s_id="16">
"We'll probably need a period of time now over which we can judge whether what the IRA says is what they actually do."
</S><S s_id="17">
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</S><S s_id="18">
The statement came four months after Adams, who denies repeated reports that he has been an IRA commander, called on the guerrilla group to embrace purely political and democratic activity.
</S><S s_id="19">
Top Sinn Fein representatives are in Washington, London and Brussels to brief international leaders on the IRA decision.
</S><S s_id="20">
The loose ends include the possible continuation of IRA criminal operations.
</S><S s_id="21">
Police blame the IRA for crimes like the robbery of $50 million from a Belfast bank last December, and the murder of a Belfast man, Robert McCartney, in January, but no prosecutions have followed in either case.
</S><S s_id="22">
Mainstream politicians want Sinn Fein, and its IRA supporters, to endorse Northern Ireland's fledgling police service, which has been revamped to gain the trust of Roman Catholics, who suffered from discrimination in the past.
</S><S s_id="23">
Dismantling the IRA's massive stashes of weapons, which are mostly hidden in underground bunkers in the countryside, has been the most stubborn obstacle to a functioning power-sharing system between Roman Catholic and Protestant political groups in Northern Ireland.
</S><S s_id="24">
The IRA has destroyed arms dumps on three separate occasions with the cooperation of John DeChastelain, the retired Canadian general who heads a commission supervising disarmament.
</S><S s_id="25">
But Unionist parties withdrew from government on several occasions after the 1998 pact in protest at the slow pace of the process.
</S><S s_id="26">
The IRA said on Wednesday that it would complete "the process to verifiably put its arms beyond use", and that it invited Protestant and Catholic clergymen to serve as witnesses so that disarmament can be completed "as quickly as possible."
</S><S s_id="27">
Analysts said that, based on DeChastelain's previous methods, the issue would likely be dealt with in a matter of days.
</S><S s_id="28">
Last December, the Democratic Unionists, led by the firebrand preacher Ian Paisley, scuttled an effort to restore Northern Ireland's government by demanding photographic evidence that the arms had been destroyed, which the IRA refused.
</S><S s_id="29">
Paisley's party, which favors continued union with Britain, indicated it would take months to negotiate a revival of Northern Ireland's power-sharing assembly.
</S><S s_id="30">
Even before the IRA statement was issued, Paisley told the BBC: "I am saying now the proof of the pudding is in the eating and digesting of it.
</S><S s_id="31">
We've heard it all before.
</S><S s_id="32">
You can wrap it up any way you like, put a new bit of ribbon on the package but we want the action, the proof this is happening."
</S><S s_id="33">
Paisley's party refuses to talk to Sinn Fein and says it is indistinguishable from the IRA.
