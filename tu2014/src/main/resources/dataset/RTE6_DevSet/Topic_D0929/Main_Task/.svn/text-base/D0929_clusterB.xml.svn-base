Oil prices bounce back above 67 dollars as Rita threatens US 
Gulf region
ATTENTION - ADDS analyst quotes, latest price ///
</S><S s_id="1">
Oil prices were higher in Asian trade Wednesday as Hurricane Rita pounded the Florida Keys islands before barreling into the Gulf of Mexico where much of US production is sourced, dealers said.
</S><S s_id="2">
At 12:30 pm (0430 GMT), New York's main contract, light sweet crude for November delivery, was up 1.28 dollars at 67.48 dollars a barrel from its close of 66.20 dollars in the United States Tuesday.
</S><S s_id="3">
"Now it is all about Hurricane Rita," said Victor Shum, an analyst with US energy consultancy Purvin and Gertz in Singapore.
</S><S s_id="4">
"That is driving up prices at the moment," he said.
</S><S s_id="5">
Rita, expected to become a major storm, was tracking a path that could roughly follow that of Hurricane Katrina into the Gulf of Mexico where about one-quarter of US oil operations are based.
</S><S s_id="6">
The path, while still uncertain, could take the powerful new storm toward Texas or possibly Louisiana, where it would likely inflict further damage on the US energy industry.
</S><S s_id="7">
Gulf of Mexico production has only been starting to recover from the shutdown caused by Katrina late last month.
</S><S s_id="8">
Now with Rita approaching, more than 58 percent of crude oil drilling and about 35 percent of natural gas production has been suspended, according to US government figures Tuesday.
</S><S s_id="9">
The US government also said 46 oil platforms had been destroyed by Katrina and 20 severely damaged while several refineries remain shut.
</S><S s_id="10">
Just the fear of Rita moving into the region sparked a jump of about seven percent in crude oil futures on Monday, while gasoline futures spiked 14.4 percent.
</S><S s_id="11">
There was some pullback in prices Tuesday but the markets remained nervous.
</S><S s_id="12">
"There are many facilities around Houston, especially natural gas facilities, offshore rigs and underground pipeline systems," said Mike Fitzpatrick, analyst at Fimat USA.

Hurricane Rita upgraded to Category Three status
</S><S s_id="1">
US meteorologists on Wednesday upgraded Hurricane Rita, which roared into the oil-rich Gulf of Mexico after slamming Cuba and the Florida Keys islands, to a more powerful Category Three category on the five-level hurricane intensity scale.
</S><S s_id="2">
At 0600 GMT Wednesday Rita packed winds of 185 kilometers (115 miles) per hour, officials at the Miami-based National Hurricane Center reported.
</S><S s_id="3">
"Additional strengthening is forecast during the next 24 hours," the Hurricane Center said in an advisory, "and Rita is expected to become a Category Four hurricane sometime later (Wednesday)."
</S><S s_id="4">
Rita's center was located some 235 kilometers (145 miles) west of Key West, Florida, and about 210 kilometers (130 miles) northwest of Havana, and was moving west in the direction of the Texas coastline at a speed of around 22 kilometers (14 miles) per hour, according to the Hurricane Center.
</S><S s_id="5">
The hurricane left more than 24,000 homes without power in Florida, sent street signs and coconuts flying and flooded parts of the only road that links the Florida Keys to the mainland.
</S><S s_id="6">
Cuba set up 600 shelters in Havana and Civil Defense reported 230,000 evacuees, including 12,000 foreigners in the tourist area of Varadero.
</S><S s_id="7">
Hurricane warnings were in effect around Havana and western provinces.
</S><S s_id="8">
In Louisiana, still recovering from Hurricane Katrina's August 29 hit, authorities were keeping a close eye on Rita, and New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin suspended the return of the city's residents because of the new threat.

Oil prices rebound on hurricane threat
</S><S s_id="1">
World oil prices made strong gains on Wednesday, as Hurricane Rita threatened fresh damage to energy facilities in the Gulf of Mexico, analysts said.
</S><S s_id="2">
New York's main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in November climbed 1.12 dollars to 67.32 dollars per barrel in electronic trading.
</S><S s_id="3">
The October contract expired Tuesday at 66.23 dollars per barrel.
</S><S s_id="4">
In London, the price of Brent North Sea crude for November delivery gained 94 cents to 65.14 dollars per barrel.
</S><S s_id="5">
Concern over Rita had boosted oil prices by more than four dollars on Monday, before they slid a day later on profit-taking.
</S><S s_id="6">
Rita was tracking a path that could roughly follow that of recent Hurricane Katrina into the Gulf of Mexico where about one-quarter of US oil operations are based.
</S><S s_id="7">
Traders were meanwhile awaiting the latest weekly snapshot of US crude inventories, whose publication later Wednesday would show the extent to which stockpiles were recovering following the destruction to rigs and refineries caused by Katrina late last month.
</S><S s_id="8">
"The market is now concerned that Hurricane Rita could extend the time that these facilities are offline for and even cause fresh damage," Sucden analyst Sam Tilley said.
</S><S s_id="9">
"The market will also be watching the US crude inventory figures," he added.

Powerful Hurricane Rita could reach top intensity: forecasters
</S><S s_id="1">
Hurricane Rita, already an "extremely dangerous" storm continued to gain strength Wednesday and could reach top intensity before it hits land, probably in Texas, the US National Hurricane Center said.
</S><S s_id="2">
"Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 140 mph (224 kilometers per hour) with higher gusts," said Lixion Avila, a forecaster with the Miami-based NHC.
</S><S s_id="3">
"Rita is an extremely dangerous category four hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale.
</S><S s_id="4">
Some additional strengthening is forecast during the next 24 hours and could reach category five intensity in the central Gulf of Mexico," he said.
</S><S s_id="5">
Forecasters believe the storm will make landfall in Texas over the weekend, but do not rule out it may hit further east on the Louisiana coast.

Texas officials on Wednesday urged voluntary evacuations of residents from areas that could lie in the path of powerful Hurricane Rita as it churned ominously toward their state.

Hurricane Rita becomes Category 5 storm

Hurricane Rita gained strength on its way towards the US Gulf Coast and turned into a Category 5 storm Wednesday afternoon, forcing authorities to order the evacuation of more than 1.3 million residents in the region.

The hurricane, with winds up to 165 mph (264 kmp), was forecast to land somewhere along the Texas Gulf Coast between Galveston and Corpus Christi Saturday.
