Attorney general to defend renewal of Patriot Act to Congress
</S><S s_id="1">
As Attorney General Alberto Gonzales prepares his defense of expiring provisions of the Patriot Act, the anti-terrorism law's opponents hope to persuade Congress not to extend what they say are intrusions into Americans' lives.
</S><S s_id="2">
Gonzales is to testify Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee and go before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.
</S><S s_id="3">
FBI Director Robert Mueller, who also wants full reauthorization of the Patriot Act, will join Gonzales for his Senate appearance.
</S><S s_id="4">
On the same day Gonzales will speak to the Senate committee, Sens.
</S><S s_id="5">
Larry Craig, an Idaho Republican, and Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, plan to reintroduce legislation designed to curb major parts of the Patriot Act that they say went too far.
</S><S s_id="6">
"Cooler heads can now see that the Patriot Act went too far, too fast and that it must be brought back in line with the Constitution," said Gregory Nojeim, associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Washington legislative office.
</S><S s_id="7">
The Patriot Act is the post-Sept. 11 law that expanded the government's surveillance and prosecutorial powers against suspected terrorists, their associates and financiers.
</S><S s_id="8">
Most of the law is permanent, but 15 provisions will expire in December unless renewed by Congress.
</S><S s_id="9">
Among them is a particularly controversial section permitting secret warrants for "books, records, papers, documents and other items" from businesses, hospitals and other organizations.
</S><S s_id="10">
That section is known as the "library provision" by its critics.
</S><S s_id="11">
While it does not specifically mention bookstores or libraries, critics say the government could use it to subpoena library and bookstore records and snoop into the reading habits of innocent Americans.
</S><S s_id="12">
That criticism has led five states and 375 communities in 43 states to pass anti-Patriot Act resolutions, the ACLU says.
</S><S s_id="13">
Even some Republicans are concerned.
</S><S s_id="14">
Senate Judiciary Chairman Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican, has suggested it should be tougher for federal officials to use that provision.
</S><S s_id="15">
Does "this really incorporate the kind of constitutional guarantees that Americans have come to expect?" said David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union.
</S><S s_id="16">
Gonzales already has agreed to two minor changes to the provision, and is expected to address those Tuesday, a Justice Department official said on condition of anonymity so as not to pre-empt Gonzales' testimony.
</S><S s_id="17">
He will support giving someone who receives a secret warrant under the provision the right to consult a lawyer and challenge the warrant in court, and will back slightly tightening the standard for issuing subpoenas, the official said.
</S><S s_id="18">
Neither of the changes addresses the central concern of critics, which is that it allows the government to seize records of people who are not suspected terrorists or spies.
</S><S s_id="19">
Gonzales and his predecessor, John Ashcroft, say the Patriot Act is a critical law enforcement tool that has helped protect the country from another terrorist attack.
</S><S s_id="20">
However, Gonzales has shown a willingness to discuss possible modifications, saying in January he would consider Specter's suggestion to make it harder for officials to obtain warrants for books, records and other reading material.
</S><S s_id="21">
"The attorney general has said before that if there are suggestions that can add to the government's ability to root out terrorists and aid us in the war on terror, he will certainly work with Congress to do that," Gonzales spokesman Kevin Madden said.
</S><S s_id="22">
"He looks forward to a healthy discussion about those provisions."
</S><S s_id="23">
But Gonzales wants the entire Patriot Act renewed and has spent significant time talking up the law in preparation for his possibly contentious appearances before Congress.
</S><S s_id="24">
"I am willing to support improvements to our laws that make America safer.
</S><S s_id="25">
What I will not support are changes in the law that would make America more vulnerable to terrorist attacks," he told a conference in February.
</S><S s_id="26">
Critics say the law allows the government to target certain groups, but the Justice Department counters that no Patriot Act-related civil rights abuses have been proven.
</S><S s_id="27">
Just in case, Craig and Durbin plan to ask Congress Tuesday to curb both expiring and nonexpiring parts of the Patriot Act, including the expiring "library" provision and "sneak and peek" or delayed notification warrants.
</S><S s_id="28">
Those warrants _ which will not expire in December _ allow federal officials to search suspects' homes without telling them until later.
</S><S s_id="29">
The Justice Department said federal prosecutors have asked for 155 such warrants since 2001.
</S><S s_id="30">
Gonzales also notes that the law has been used in non-terrorism cases.
</S><S s_id="31">
But non-terrorism uses are part of what concerns Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform.
</S><S s_id="32">
"Many of us remember what happened with RICO," the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, Norquist said.
</S><S s_id="33">
"It was originally passed and they were going to go after organized crime figures in dark shirts and they ended up using it against pro-life demonstrators years later."

Senators debate merits of Patriot Act while agreeing no abuses have been documented
</S><S s_id="1">
Critics of the USA Patriot Act called for the Senate to temper the anti-terrorism law's provisions that let police conduct secret searches of people's homes or businesses, but defenders say since no abuses have been documented the law should be renewed.
</S><S s_id="2">
The Bush administration wants Congress to make permanent all 15 provisions of the law that expire at the end of the year, some of which have aroused civil liberties concerns among liberals and conservatives.
</S><S s_id="3">
The law's national standards for what are sometimes known as "sneak and peek" searches are permanent.
</S><S s_id="4">
Sens.
</S><S s_id="5">
Larry Craig, an Idaho Republican, and Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, told the Senate Judiciary Committee that while they cannot show any specific abuses, the anti-terrorism law is written in a way that could allow abuses.
</S><S s_id="6">
"Our law cannot be written for the best and the brightest.
</S><S s_id="7">
They must also anticipate enforcement from the worst and the weakest," said Craig, who is pushing a bill with Durbin that would scale back some of the Patriot Act's powers.
</S><S s_id="8">
Critics of the law want Congress to pass the SAFE Act to limit the Patriot Act in several ways, including requiring government officials to inform suspects about the "sneak and peek" searches within seven days if a judge does not intervene.
</S><S s_id="9">
The current law does not specify when the government has to inform suspects about the secret search.
</S><S s_id="10">
"We do not want to end the Patriot Act.
</S><S s_id="11">
We want to mend the Patriot Act," Durbin said.
</S><S s_id="12">
Sen. Jon Kyl, an Arizona Republican, defended the anti-terrorism law, saying that since no one can come up with specific abuses, the expiring provisions should be renewed.
</S><S s_id="13">
"In this particular area because there has been no problems, it seems to be me that the assumption underlying the sunset provisions ought to move forward, which is, there being no problems, the act ought to be reauthorized," Kyl said.
</S><S s_id="14">
The Justice Department has said that the courts authorized 155 delayed search warrants under the Patriot Act through January.

Lawmakers Ponder Sunset Provision of Patriot Act
</S><S s_id="1">
When Congress enacted the Patriot Act after the Sept. 11 attacks, it put the Justice Department on a short leash, mandating that many of the new powers in the act would last only four years unless renewed by Congress.
</S><S s_id="2">
Now, as lawmakers are debating an administration proposal to make those provisions permanent, Republicans and Democrats are wondering whether they should retain the "sunset" provisions to ensure a degree of Justice Department accountability.
</S><S s_id="3">
The issue is apt to become an important part of the debate as Cong Congress every couple of years and justify the provisions," a spokesman said.
</S><S s_id="4">
"There seems to be strong bipartisan support for keeping sunsets in the Patriot Act, even after Congress decides what parts will be reauthorized and what parts will be amended," said Gregory Nojeim, associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union legislative office.
</S><S s_id="5">
"It appears that members believe that the sunset helps encourage the Department of Justice to be more forthcoming with information about how the Patriot Act is being used," he added.
</S><S s_id="6">
Indeed, the uncertain fate of the law has resulted in a burst of detailed new information from the Justice Department about how it has been used.
</S><S s_id="7">
At a Senate hearing Tuesday, Gonzales released declassified information showing how often the department had used powerful new tools under the law.
</S><S s_id="8">
These included provisions covering the collection of a wide range of business records, and search warrants that allow the government to delay notifying the target of a warrant until sometimes weeks or months after the search has taken place, a practice critics call "sneak and peek."
</S><S s_id="9">
The department also gave Congress a 69-page analysis of how the expiring provisions have operated..
</S><S s_id="10">
"I think it's a strong record of success.
</S><S s_id="11">
I think that the act has been effective.
</S><S s_id="12">
I think that the department has acted responsibly," Gonzales said.

CONGRESS BEGINS RECONSIDERATION OF PATRIOT ACT

CONGRESS BEGINS RECONSIDERATION OF PATRIOT ACT
</S><S s_id="1">
With five state legislatures in revolt against the Patriot Act, Congress begins reconsideration of the sweeping anti-terrorism legislation Tuesday amid clamor for changes from the political right and left.
</S><S s_id="2">
Last week, Montana joined four other states that have passed resolutions urging Congress to curb the new powers hastily granted to federal law enforcement agencies six weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
</S><S s_id="3">
This latest resolution to restrict the Patriot Act "protects our states rights and is what true Republicans in every 'red state' should be doing," said Rick Maedje, a GOP member of the Montana House of Representatives.
</S><S s_id="4">
However, similar measures urging restrictions on the Patriot Act have also passed in the 'blue states' of Vermont, Maine and Hawaii -- which tend to vote Democratic in national elections -- as well as in the 'red states' of Alaska and Montana.
</S><S s_id="5">
A coalition to rein in the Patriot Act is headed by former Rep. Bob Barr, a conservative Georgia Republican, and has members ranging from the American Civil Liberties Union on the ideological left to Americans For Tax Reform on the right.
</S><S s_id="6">
"It's our number one legislative priority," Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the ACLU, said Monday.
</S><S s_id="7">
Portions of the act will expire at the end of this year if Congress does not vote to renew them, as President Bush has requested.
</S><S s_id="8">
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales will begin making the administration's case to Congress this week, testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday and the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.
</S><S s_id="9">
Hearings are likely to continue into the summer before any measures come up for a vote.
</S><S s_id="10">
"I expect these national hearings to be very thorough and I'm certain there will be probing questions from senators on both sides of the aisle," said Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
</S><S s_id="11">
"There are few issues that are more important to this committee and the American people than protecting our citizen's precious civil rights and civil liberties while continuing the battle against terror," said Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., the ranking minority member on the House committee.
</S><S s_id="12">
The Patriot Act gave the federal government greater powers of surveillance, investigation and prosecution to use against suspected terrorists and their enablers.
</S><S s_id="13">
However, opponents said it has also been used to bypass the constitutional requirements for "probable cause" in issuing warrants in ordinary criminal investigations and in other manners unrelated to terrorism.
</S><S s_id="14">
"Despite the secrecy that permeates the Patriot Act, it's clear that it has been abused and misused," said Romero in a letter sent Monday to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., a member of the Judiciary Committee.
</S><S s_id="15">
"The government has committed these transgressions without apology or regret and has simultaneously sought to expand the powers granted under the Patriot Act."
</S><S s_id="16">
In the letter, the ACLU said the act had been used to carry out a secret search of the home of Brandon Mayfield, a Muslim attorney in Portland, Ore., who was wrongly suspected of complicity in the 2004 terrorist bombing of a train in Madrid, Spain.
</S><S s_id="17">
The ACLU also charged abuse or misuse of the act in keeping Tariq Ramadan, a "widely respected Muslim scholar," from entering the United States and for prosecuting Sami al-Hussayen, a Muslim student in Idaho, for posting Internet links to materials the Justice Department deemed "objectionable."
</S><S s_id="18">
Sens.
</S><S s_id="19">
Larry Craig, R-Idaho, and Richard Durbin, D-Ill., plan to introduce the "Safety and Freedom Enforcement" or SAFE Act on Tuesday, aimed at eliminating some of the Patriot Act provisions that opponents view as most extreme.
</S><S s_id="20">
It would deal with the so-called "sneak and peek" provision, which allows federal agents to secretly search people's homes and businesses without any deadline on giving notice that the intrusion had taken place.
</S><S s_id="21">
The SAFE Act would also curb a part of the Patriot Act that allows federal agents to collect personal data on ordinary Americans -- such as their medical history, books they check-out at the library and goods they purchase -- without evidence that the citizen is connected to terrorism.
</S><S s_id="22">
And it modifies a section that opponents say defines "terrorism" too broadly, making law-abiding critics of federal policy subject to investigation.
</S><S s_id="23">
(Story can end here; Optional add follows)
</S><S s_id="24">
In addition to the five state legislatures, the ACLU said 375 county and city governments in 43 states have passed resolutions warning against threats that the Patriot Act could pose to civil liberties.
</S><S s_id="25">
In a March 7 speech to county officials, Gonzales contended that some of these votes were based on "misinformation or a lack of information."
</S><S s_id="26">
"The act has helped us considerably in the war on terrorism," Gonzales said.
</S><S s_id="27">
Romero said the ACLU has never opposed the Patriot Act in its entirety.
</S><S s_id="28">
Some provisions were needed to fight terrorism, he said, "but some provisions went too far."

US NEARLY DOUBLES USE OF PATRIOT ACT SEARCH POWER
</HEADLINE><TEXT><S s_id="0">
US NEARLY DOUBLES USE OF PATRIOT ACT SEARCH POWER
</S><S s_id="1">
WASHINGTON - Justice Department investigators nearly doubled the rate at which they used a controversial new search-and-seizure power, allowed under the USA PATRIOT Act, during the past 22 months, according to data released by the Bush administration Monday on the eve of congressional testimony by Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
</S><S s_id="2">
Formally called delayed-notification searches, the warrants are known as "sneak and peek" because they allow investigators to search a person's home or business and to seize property without disclosing for weeks or months that they were there.
</S><S s_id="3">
Although investigators must convince a judge that there is a "reasonable suspicion" that the investigation would be harmed if the subject were notified, no judge has ever denied a request for those searches.
</S><S s_id="4">
Although the warrants are codified in a law enacted to fight terrorism, they are not limited to terrorism investigations.
</S><S s_id="5">
And, according to the Justice Department, investigators have increasingly resorted to the power since the Patriot Act became law shortly after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
</S><S s_id="6">
The Justice Department said Monday that the power was a valuable law enforcement tool for a "wide spectrum of criminal investigations, including those involving terrorism and drugs."
</S><S s_id="7">
But the American Civil Liberties Union said the release "confirms our worst fears" that the use of the law is expanding beyond terrorism investigations, and called for greater oversight.
</S><S s_id="8">
The Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday intends to question Gonzales and FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III about how the Justice Department has been using its Patriot Act powers, setting the stage for a year of political debate over whether to make the Patriot Act permanent or to scale it back.
</S><S s_id="9">
In May 2003, the Justice Department released its initial data on how often it had used the search power, covering Oct. 26, 2001, to April 1, 2003.
</S><S s_id="10">
During those roughly 17 months, it asked for and got sneak-and-peek warrants 47 times, or about 2.7 times a month.
</S><S s_id="11">
According to data released MOnday, investigators sought the warrants 108 times in 22 months - from April 1, 2003, to Jan. 21, 2005, a rate of 4.9 times a month.
</S><S s_id="12">
The Justice Department said in its statement that sneak-and-peek searches are a very small fraction of the total number of search warrants it uses in its investigations.
</S><S s_id="13">
The searches allow agents to gather evidence against subjects without tipping them off that they are under scrutiny - something that could prompt them to flee, destroy evidence, or menace a witness.
</S><S s_id="14">
"The department estimates that court-approved delayed-notification warrants represent less than 0.2 percent of the search warrants utilized by law enforcement," the statement said.
</S><S s_id="15">
The law also allows the clandestine seizure of property when a judge finds that it is "reasonably necessary."
</S><S s_id="16">
The Justice Department said it has sought such authorization 45 times since the Patriot Act became law.
</S><S s_id="17">
But the ACLU said the "highly intrusive" searches "are being used primarily outside of the terrorism arena.
</S><S s_id="18">
Congress must insist on receiving more detailed information on each of these searches and why each was necessary."
</S><S s_id="19">
Delayed-notification search warrants are among the enhanced police powers included in the Patriot Act.
</S><S s_id="20">
Although judges have had the authority to approve no-notification warrants in certain criminal cases for decades, the power did not become codified until the Patriot Act.
</S><S s_id="21">
The ACLU and other critics have called for greater checks on the power, including stricter standards for when and how a judge may authorize sneak-and-peek searches.
</S><S s_id="22">
According to the Justice Department data, no judge has ever denied a law enforcement request for such search-and-seizure warrants.
</S><S s_id="23">
Gonzales's and Mueller's testimony Tuesday before the committee will mark the start of the Bush administration's campaign to persuade Congress to make the entire Patriot Act permanent this year.
</S><S s_id="24">
Several of its provisions are due to expire at the end of the year, although the sneak-and-peek" search is not one of them.
</S><S s_id="25">
A coalition of liberal and conservative libertarians plan to call Tuesday for the passage of the "Safety and Freedom Enhanced Act," which would amend several of the Patriot Act's provisions to provide for greater safeguards and oversight on when and how the powers are used.
</S><S s_id="26">
Arlen Specter, chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee and a Republican of Pennsylvania, said Monday that reauthorizing "certain key provisions" of the Patriot Act is necessary, but he left the door open to scaling it back, contending that he is "mindful of the strong criticism which is coming from both the right and left of the political spectrum."
</S><S s_id="27">
Democratic Senate aides said Gonzales will also face questioning regarding FBI agents who allegedly witnessed "torture techniques" during interrogations of "enemy combatants" at the Guantanamo Bay Navy Base in 2002.

GONZALES SIGNALS COMPROMISE ON PATRIOT ACT
</HEADLINE><TEXT><S s_id="0">
GONZALES SIGNALS COMPROMISE ON PATRIOT ACT
</S><S s_id="1">
WASHINGTON - Attorney General Alberto Gonzales signaled Tuesday that the Bush administration is open to compromise with civil liberties advocates on key provisions of the USA Patriot Act as it comes up for renewal this year, shifting away from the hard-line stance of his predecessor, John Ashcroft.
</S><S s_id="2">
Gonzales, testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday, also revealed that the FBI had used Patriot Act surveillance powers to monitor an Oregon lawyer who last year was wrongly jailed for 14 days as a "material witness" in the March 2004 Madrid train bombings.
</S><S s_id="3">
And Gonzales disclosed that FBI agents have used Patriot Act search warrants 35 times to obtain business records deemed relevant to a terrorism investigation.
</S><S s_id="4">
In May 2004, Ashcroft publicly said such warrants had never been used.
</S><S s_id="5">
None of those 35 warrants were used on libraries, but FBI Director Robert Mueller said some libraries have voluntarily provided information, such as data from computers used by a suspect for Internet access.
</S><S s_id="6">
Librarian groups have been sharp critics of the Patriot Act, arguing that people's reading habits should be protected from government surveillance.
</S><S s_id="7">
"As Congress considers whether to renew these provisions, I am open to suggestions for clarifying and strengthening the act," Gonzales said.
</S><S s_id="8">
"I look forward to meeting with those both inside and outside of Congress who have expressed concerns about the act.
</S><S s_id="9">
But let me be clear that I will not support any proposal that would undermine our ability to combat terrorism effectively."
</S><S s_id="10">
During his tenure, Ashcroft threatened that President Bush would use his first veto if Congress modified the Patriot Act, and members from both parties criticized the former attorney general for failing to answer questions about how the Justice Department was using the law.
</S><S s_id="11">
Gonzales' disclosures about how the Patriot Act has been used and his willingness to entertain revisions of the law were cheered by members of both parties.
</S><S s_id="12">
"I am heartened by your opening statement, Attorney General, about being open to suggestions and ideas," said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the Democratic whip.
</S><S s_id="13">
"It is a grand departure from your predecessor, and I think it is the right spirit for us to address the Patriot Act."
</S><S s_id="14">
Congress passed the Patriot Act shortly after Sept. 11, 2001.
</S><S s_id="15">
Most of it is dedicated to sharing information between law-enforcement and spy agencies.
</S><S s_id="16">
But its provisions granting FBI agents greater power to search people's computers, telephones, and homes have become powerful symbols to civil libertarians.
</S><S s_id="17">
Sixteen provisions of the Patriot Act are due to expire at the end of 2005, and Bush has said it is a priority for Congress to make them permanent.
</S><S s_id="18">
Testimony by Gonzales and Mueller Tuesday opened a new season of political debate over the measure.
</S><S s_id="19">
"In the United States, with our deep tradition for civil rights and constitutional law, that concern for security has to be balanced by due regard for civil rights," said Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania and chairman of the Judiciary Committee.
</S><S s_id="20">
He added later, "This is a very knotty problem.
</S><S s_id="21">
I think there has to be some give on some of these authorities."
</S><S s_id="22">
Meanwhile, Senator Larry Craig, an Idaho Republican, and Durbin filed a bipartisan bill Tuesday that would provide more public notification and scrutiny of Justice Department actions under the Patriot Act.
</S><S s_id="23">
Among other changes, their measure would require that most people be notified of secret search warrants against them within seven days of the search.
</S><S s_id="24">
It also would make certain that nonviolent political protests are not covered by the act.
</S><S s_id="25">
"Clearly the civil liberties of this country are its strength," Craig said.
</S><S s_id="26">
"Out of fear, we should not run from those principles, nor should we deny ourselves those rights and those protections."
</S><S s_id="27">
Libertarians have also suggested carving out exceptions for libraries and bookstores from the "business records" that may be sought under the Patriot Act.
</S><S s_id="28">
But Gonzales argued that the power should be preserved, even as he stressed that the warrants have so far been used only for driver's license, credit card, and telephone records, not reading lists.
</S><S s_id="29">
"It should not be held against us that we've exercised, in my judgment, restraint," Gonzales said.
</S><S s_id="30">
Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, expressed impatience with the arguments by librarians, cutting off Mueller when the FBI director was discussing how to balance security and the "sanctity" of libraries.
</S><S s_id="31">
"A library doesn't have any sanctity," Sessions said, adding that librarians "think it's sanctified, I'll admit.
</S><S s_id="32">
I just disagree that it deserves special protection."
</S><S s_id="33">
Gonzales also argued against a proposal to raise the standard of proof before a judge may authorize a search of business records.
</S><S s_id="34">
Nevertheless, the attorney general said he would be happy to discuss compromises.
</S><S s_id="35">
He offered two proposals for clarifying business record search warrants, saying the law should make clear that they are for national security investigations only, and business owners are allowed to challenge the warrants in court.
</S><S s_id="36">
Greg Nojeim, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the Justice Department has already conceded those restrictions in court cases.
</S><S s_id="37">
But he called Gonzales' willingness to consider other modifications "a welcome and constructive change."
</S><S s_id="38">
"We believe the changes that the attorney general mentioned today were conceded long ago and much more needs to be done to bring the Patriot Act in line with the Constitution," he said.

EDITORIAL: REVISING THE PATRIOT ACT

EDITORIAL: REVISING THE PATRIOT ACT
</S><S s_id="1">
The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, April 10:
</S><S s_id="2">
When Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who is not exactly a renowned civil libertarian, says the Patriot Act may need some adjustments, it clearly has serious problems.
</S><S s_id="3">
The act, which was rushed through Congress after the Sept. 11 attacks, gives government too much power to invade the privacy of ordinary Americans and otherwise trample on their rights.
</S><S s_id="4">
Congress, which is now reviewing the act, should rewrite the parts that violate civil liberties.
</S><S s_id="5">
But it is important to realize that most of the worst post-Sept. 11 abuses did not stem from the Patriot Act.
</S><S s_id="6">
If Congress wants to restore the civil liberties Americans have lost in the last three and a half years, it must also look more broadly at the problems that have emerged from the war on terror.
</S><S s_id="7">
After Sept. 11, Congress was in such a rush to pass the Patriot Act that, disturbingly, many members did not even read it before they voted for it.
</S><S s_id="8">
Fortunately, Congress made some of the most controversial provisions expire by the end of 2005.
</S><S s_id="9">
Last week, it began a series of hearings on the act, focusing on the parts that need to be reauthorized.
</S><S s_id="10">
The debate over the Patriot Act is too often conducted in bumper stickers, in part because the details are so arcane.
</S><S s_id="11">
Parts of the law are reasonable law enforcement measures that have generated little controversy.
</S><S s_id="12">
But other parts unquestionably go too far, and invite the FBI, the CIA and the White House to spy on Americans, and suppress political dissent, in unacceptable ways.
</S><S s_id="13">
Libraries and Medical Records Section 215, often called the "library provision," is one of the most criticized parts of the act, with good reason.
</S><S s_id="14">
It allows the government to demand library, medical, and other records, and makes it a crime for the record holders to reveal that the request was made.
</S><S s_id="15">
Section 215 is written far too broadly.
</S><S s_id="16">
It lets the government seize an entire database -- all the medical records of a hospital, all of the files of an immigration group -- when it is investigating a single person.
</S><S s_id="17">
It also is far too invasive; it is hard to believe the FBI needs to monitor library book circulation.
</S><S s_id="18">
If the searches are allowed, Section 215 should be tightened to give the government access only to records of a specific person it has legitimate reason to believe is involved in terrorism, not an entire database.
</S><S s_id="19">
The "gag rule" that makes it illegal for the record holder to talk publicly about the search also is disturbing, because it prevents the public from knowing if the government is abusing these sweeping powers.
</S><S s_id="20">
If the gag rule remains, it should be limited, so record holders can speak about the search after a suitable period of time, or talk about it right away without revealing who the target was.
</S><S s_id="21">
Secret Searches Section 213, the "sneak and peek" provision, lets the government search a person's home and delay telling him about it.
</S><S s_id="22">
These delayed-notification searches fly in the face of the strong American tradition that the government must announce when it is entering a home.
</S><S s_id="23">
Delayed-notification searches were of questionable legality before the Patriot Act, and Section 213 -- which does not expire this year, but is still generating considerable debate -- clearly goes too far.
</S><S s_id="24">
At the very least, it should apply only to terrorism cases, and not, as it now does, to all investigations.
</S><S s_id="25">
It should also have clear guidelines for how long notice can be delayed.
</S><S s_id="26">
Secret searches are an area where focusing only on the Patriot Act misses the larger picture of civil liberties violations.
</S><S s_id="27">
There is another law, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, that allows a worse kind of secret search -- one in which, unlike the delayed notification of Section 213, the subject may never be told about the search at all.
</S><S s_id="28">
One way for Congress to deal with searches under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act -- as well as those under sections 213 and 215 of the Patriot Act -- is to monitor them closely, which is not being done now.
</S><S s_id="29">
Congressional staff members with appropriate security clearance should review all requests for warrants or subpoenas, and should follow up on the results of the searches.
</S><S s_id="30">
If the FBI, CIA or other units of government are using these tools to spy on Americans without sufficient justification, Congress needs this information to rein them in.
</S><S s_id="31">
INFORMATION SHARING: Giving different units of government more power to share information about suspected terrorists is a laudable goal, but the Patriot Act's approach is flawed.
</S><S s_id="32">
It authorizes the FBI, the CIA, and even the White House sweeping access to confidential information gathered about Americans, including telephone and e-mail intercepts.
</S><S s_id="33">
The access is not limited to officials working on terrorism.
</S><S s_id="34">
And it sweeps in information, like confidential material acquired by grand juries, that has always been closely guarded.
</S><S s_id="35">
There is a real danger that the new regime established by the act could produce a massive database on Americans, freely available to all units of government.
</S><S s_id="36">
The Patriot Act makes the same mistake the FBI and CIA have long made: favoring information quantity over quality.
</S><S s_id="37">
The universe of data that is shared should be narrowed, to focus on information closely related to suspected terrorism, and rather than being indiscriminately dumped, it should be given only to officials, at whatever agency, engaged in investigating terrorism.
</S><S s_id="38">
In the case of data collected subject to the special powers of a court, such as wiretaps and secret grand jury material, a judge's approval should be required before it is simply dumped into a general database.
</S><S s_id="39">
BEYOND THE PATRIOT ACT: At last week's hearings, Gonzales conceded that the Patriot Act may need some adjustment, while the Justice Department is largely standing by the law, and the FBI is even seeking to expand it.
</S><S s_id="40">
But a coalition of Republicans and Democrats in Congress, backed by such unlikely allies as the American Civil Liberties Union and the American Conservative Union, is pushing for changes.
</S><S s_id="41">
In the coming weeks, there will be more hearings on how the act can be improved.
</S><S s_id="42">
These hearings should look beyond the Patriot Act, to the larger picture of civil liberties and the war on terror.
</S><S s_id="43">
After Sept. 11, the government rounded up illegal immigrants, and put hundreds with no ties to terrorism behind bars for months, often in deplorable conditions.
</S><S s_id="44">
The Justice Department's own inspector general found that the government made "little attempt" to distinguish people with ties to terrorism from those without.
</S><S s_id="45">
In conducting this roundup, the Bush administration gave itself far more power than the Patriot Act does.
</S><S s_id="46">
Under the act, aliens are to be held no more than seven days before immigration or criminal charges are brought.
</S><S s_id="47">
Nor did the Bush administration rely on the Patriot Act for its lawless "enemy combatant" doctrine, the basis for holding American citizens suspected of terrorism indefinitely, without access to family members or lawyers.
</S><S s_id="48">
And the administration now claims that the CIA has the right to secretly transfer suspected terrorists to foreign countries for interrogation.
</S><S s_id="49">
Critics of the process, known as rendition, say it is being used to subject these suspects to torture.
</S><S s_id="50">
The authority for rendition comes not from the Patriot Act, but from a classified directive that President Bush signed shortly after 9/11.
</S><S s_id="51">
If Congress becomes too bogged down in the minutiae of the Patriot Act in coming weeks, it will be in danger of missing the larger picture.
</S><S s_id="52">
Revising the law should be the start, not the end, of its work.

PANEL TO WEIGH BEEFED-UP PATRIOT ACT
</HEADLINE><TEXT><S s_id="0">
PANEL TO WEIGH BEEFED-UP PATRIOT ACT
</S><S s_id="1">
WASHINGTON - The Senate Intelligence Committee will meet behind closed doors this week to consider legislation that could dramatically expand the government's police powers under the USA Patriot Act, including a little-discussed provision to enlarge the FBI's ability to wiretap people who it suspects are national security threats.
</S><S s_id="2">
The proposal, in a draft bill sponsored by committee chairman Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, would lift one of the last restrictions on special warrants the FBI can obtain through a secret court originally set up to monitor foreign spies: that the information the bureau wants must be related to international terrorism or foreign intelligence.
</S><S s_id="3">
Instead, the FBI could use the warrants, which bypass normal constitutional safeguards, to look for evidence of unrelated crimes that it could use to get suspects off the street.
</S><S s_id="4">
The wiretap provision is one of three major additions in the draft bill, which would reauthorize the Patriot Act, the package of enhanced law enforcement powers enacted after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
</S><S s_id="5">
If the bill became law, it also would give FBI agents the power to write their own subpoenas without permission from a judge, allowing them to seize records from hotels, banks, and Internet service providers.
</S><S s_id="6">
This provision would require the FBI to make periodic reports to Congress about how often it uses that power to obtain library records, bookstore and firearms sales receipts, and medical or tax records.
</S><S s_id="7">
The bureau also would have the authority to order the US Postal Service to make and turn over photocopies of envelopes addressed to or sent from people who have some connection to ongoing national security investigations.
</S><S s_id="8">
And the bill would extend the deadline before the FBI is required to ask a judge to extend or renew a wiretap.
</S><S s_id="9">
The draft bill Roberts has sponsored would escalate the government agents' police powers at a time when civil libertarians have been trying to roll back the Patriot Act by urging greater oversight of investigations by courts and Congress.
</S><S s_id="10">
The Intelligence Committee bill doesn't include the new safeguards that critics, including both Democrats and Republicans, have proposed.
</S><S s_id="11">
Lisa Graves, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, called the proposed bill a strategic maneuver by Republicans to shift arguments from curbing the Patriot Act to expanding it.
</S><S s_id="12">
"It's an attempt to force the debate onto their terms, versus where the momentum has been headed, which is to roll back the Patriot Act to bring it in line with the Constitution and make sure its tools are focused on terrorists, as opposed to Americans," Graves said.
</S><S s_id="13">
The draft of Roberts's proposal is still largely under wraps, and no one at the Justice Department nor the Intelligence Committee was available to comment on it late last week.
</S><S s_id="14">
It was given to a small group of specialists who testified at the only public hearing in the Intelligence Committee in late May.
</S><S s_id="15">
At that little-noticed hearing, the FBI's general counsel, Valerie Caproni, testified that the Justice Department strongly supported Roberts' bill.
</S><S s_id="16">
"Many of the most important provisions of the USA Patriot Act ... are scheduled to sunset at the end of this year, and the [Justice]
</S><S s_id="17">
Department therefore applauds this committee for taking up legislation that would make permanent those provisions," she said, according to her prepared opening statement at the hearing.
</S><S s_id="18">
"We are also heartened that this committee has come forward with novel and worthwhile ideas for strengthening the department's counterterrorism capabilities."
</S><S s_id="19">
Two of the new powers the Intelligence Committee would give to the FBI bear a strong resemblance to tools the bureau has long coveted, but which federal judges in the past have rejected.
</S><S s_id="20">
In 2002, the Bush administration argued that, under the original language of the Patriot Act, it should be able to use the national security warrants from the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to look for evidence of ordinary crimes as a way to keep suspected terrorists off the streets - the same idea contained in the Roberts bill.
</S><S s_id="21">
It was rejected by a special review panel for the secret court.
</S><S s_id="22">
"We see not the slightest indication that Congress meant to give that power to the Executive Branch," wrote the panel, made up of federal appeals court judges.
</S><S s_id="23">
The national security warrant process, they declared, "cannot be used as a device to investigate wholly unrelated crimes."
</S><S s_id="24">
The possibility that the FBI could get such powers under a renewed Patriot Act has alarmed civil libertarians.
</S><S s_id="25">
"From a constitutional standpoint, that would be devastating because it would essentially render the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizure completely meaningless," said former US Representative Bob Barr, the Georgia Republican who became a civil liberties specialist for the American Conservative Union, the nation's oldest conservative lobbying organization, after leaving Congress in 2003.
</S><S s_id="26">
Although the powers sought by the FBI in the Roberts bill are significant, neither Roberts nor the Bush administration has made a strong effort to build a public case for why the bureau needs them before the bill is finalized.
</S><S s_id="27">
Attempts to get a comment from Roberts's spokesman on the Intelligence Committee or from the Justice Department, which supervises the FBI, were unsuccessful.
</S><S s_id="28">
Members of the committee staff and representatives of the Justice Department said that the two people who are authorized to talk about the Patriot Act were both away, and that no one else could comment.
</S><S s_id="29">
The FBI was rejected in a prior attempt to write its own subpoenas for records from businesses if agents determined that the records were "relevant" to a national security investigation - considered a very low standard to meet.
</S><S s_id="30">
Last fall, judges stripped the bureau of that power, declaring it unconstitutional.
</S><S s_id="31">
Laws dating back to 1986 had granted the bureau the power to write its own subpoenas to get telephone and Internet records for national security investigations of foreign agents.
</S><S s_id="32">
Business owners served with those FBI demand letters were permanently gagged from telling anyone about the incident, including their clients and their own lawyers.
</S><S s_id="33">
In 2001, the Patriot Act removed a key requirement.
</S><S s_id="34">
Now, the subject only has to be "relevant" to investigations of suspected terrorists or foreign spies, a significantly broader standard.
</S><S s_id="35">
After FBI agents used the power to demand unspecified customer service records from an Internet service provider, the company challenged the bureau in court instead of complying.
</S><S s_id="36">
In September 2004, a judge ruled that power unconstitutional, saying that it violated both free speech and unreasonable search protections.
</S><S s_id="37">
That case is still under appeal, but the draft bill would restore the power and expand it to any kind of records, papers, or other "tangible things" about a target which are held by a third party, with new procedures intended to address the constitutional issues.
</S><S s_id="38">
Civil libertarians argue that the FBI has not clearly shown how its investigations have been hampered for lack of this power.
</S><S s_id="39">
And they warn that - unlike the Internet service provider who took the bureau to court - few business owners will assume the expense of fighting such a subpoena, even if it is unreasonable, since their own privacy is not at stake.
</S><S s_id="40">
Moreover, the Roberts provisions would surpass what is already one of the most controversial parts of the original Patriot Act: a section that allows the FBI to get warrants for customer records from the secret court, which was created in 1978 by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
</S><S s_id="41">
This provision has been attacked by a range of critics, including librarians, who fear it will be used to obtain reading lists of their patrons.
</S><S s_id="42">
The Bush administration has said it has never used this power against libraries.
</S><S s_id="43">
At a time when critics of the Patriot Act want to curtail this power, the Intelligence Committee proposal would eliminate its final check - lifting the requirement that the FBI get permission from the secret court before seizing the records.
</S><S s_id="44">
"The administrative subpoena proposal is alarming because [the Patriot Act version] was already way broader than anything they needed," argued Stephen Schulhofer, a New York University law professor and author of a new book about the Patriot Act.

PRUNING THE PATRIOT ACT (FOR USE
</S><S s_id="1">
PRUNING THE PATRIOT ACTCONGRESS APPROVED the USA Patriot Act in a flush of fear following the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001, but it had the good sense to put a time limit on many of the most controversial sections so they expire next Dec. 31.
</S><S s_id="2">
It ought to assess their effectiveness and potential for abuse rather than toughening the act, as one influential senator proposes.
</S><S s_id="3">
Pat Roberts, a Kansas Republican who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee, wants to expand the ability of the FBI to use search warrants issued by a secret intelligence court.
</S><S s_id="4">
Under Roberts's plan, the agents could use this authority to look for evidence of crimes unrelated to the purpose of the warrants.
</S><S s_id="5">
Roberts would also allow FBI agents to write their own subpoenas without having to get permission from a judge.
</S><S s_id="6">
And the FBI would be able to order the US Postal Service to provide copies of envelopes addressed to or sent from people linked to national security investigations.
</S><S s_id="7">
Neither Roberts nor the FBI has yet made the case that these powers are essential to thwart terrorism.
</S><S s_id="8">
The senator's attempt to attach them to renewal of the Patriot Act has diverted attention from more pressing matters, such as whether this sprawling piece of legislation has been effective and whether it infringes on Americans' liberties.
</S><S s_id="9">
In "Rethinking the Patriot Act," a study to be released this week by the Century Foundation in New York, legal scholar Stephen J. Schulhofer concludes that while some sections of the law are useful, its implications for civil liberties are troubling and its impact on terrorism is unclear.
</S><S s_id="10">
Schulhofer joins many librarians who worry that enhanced search powers for documents allows government agents to rummage through Americans' private records, including the books they borrow.
</S><S s_id="11">
No doubt most federal agents will use common sense when seeking this information, but the risk of abuse is still too high for this section to remain in effect.
</S><S s_id="12">
Roberts's committee, which was drafting its version of a Patriot Act extension yesterday, will not have the last word on revising the law; the House has yet to prepare its own proposal.
</S><S s_id="13">
Congress ought to be pruning unnecessary, intrusive sections instead of adding more threats to personal liberty.
</S><S s_id="14">
Congress passed the Patriot Act in a climate of understandable urgency.
</S><S s_id="15">
Schulhofer concludes that "legal limitations bear little if any of the blame for Sept. 11."
</S><S s_id="16">
With the advantage of hindsight and with adequate time to deliberate, Congress has an important chance to get it right this year.
