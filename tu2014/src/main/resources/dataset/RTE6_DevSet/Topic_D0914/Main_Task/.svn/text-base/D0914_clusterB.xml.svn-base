"Islamic Unity Brigades" claim Sinai attacks: website
</S><S s_id="1">
A group calling itself "Islamic Unity Brigades" claimed responsibility Friday for a series of bombings in Egypt's Sinai peninsula targeting Israeli tourists, and which Israel has blamed on Al-Qaeda.

"Four of your martyrdom-seeking brothers (suicide bombers) carried out this heroic operation... against a den of prostitution and corruption," said a statement posted on an Islamist website whose authenticity could not be confirmed.

At least 19 dead in Red Sea resort blasts; Israel blames Al-Qaeda

At least 19 dead in Red Sea resort blasts; Israel blames Al-Qaeda
</S><S s_id="1">
Car bombs ripped through a major hotel and two beach resorts packed with Israeli tourists on the Red Sea coast of Egypt's Sinai desert, killing at least 19 people and causing scenes of mayhem in attacks that Israel blamed on Al-Qaeda.
</S><S s_id="2">
The biggest of the string of explosions late Thursday left a trail of carnage and destruction at the 10-storey Hilton hotel in Taba, a town just across the Israeli border that once hosted Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</S><S s_id="3">
"According to our first information, it appears to be an international terror attack with the hallmarks of Al-Qaeda," Israel's deputy defence minister Zeev Boim said.
</S><S s_id="4">
The explosions occurred as Israelis were celebrating the end of the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, and followed intelligence warnings that Israelis should keep out of the Sinai because of possible attacks.
</S><S s_id="5">
Estimates of the number of dead varied through the night as rescuers combed the rubbaeli public television.
</S><S s_id="6">
Israeli police said the explosion was caused by a powerful car bomb detonated near the entrance to the four-star Hilton, destroying a wing of the building.
</S><S s_id="7">
Footage showed collapse staircases and tangled piles of metal and concrete South Sinai governor General Mustafa Afifi said two charred trucks were found at the tourist camps of Shitani and Ras Soltan on the coast road south of Taba, indicating that the blasts were also caused by car bombs.
</S><S s_id="8">
Egypt threw up a security cordon around the blast sites in the Sinai -- renowned for its dramatic desert mountains and palm-fringed beaches -- and boosted airport security in Cairo.
</S><S s_id="9">
A previously unknown group calling itself "Islamic Unity Brigades" claimed responsibility for the attacks saying they were in revenge for Israel's assassination of Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin last March.

The explosions came amid a massive Israeli army offensive in the north of the Gaza Strip, a wedge of land near the border with Egypt, that has left 93 Palestinians dead in less than 10 days.

Israel blames Al-Qaeda for Sinai bombings
(ADDS FM quotes, background)
</S><S s_id="1">
Israel on Friday blamed Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda terror network for a series of anti-Israeli bomb attacks against in Egypt's Sinai peninsula that left at least 19 people dead and another 38 missing.
</S><S s_id="2">
"According to our first information, it appears to be an international terror attack with the hallmarks of Al-Qaeda," Israel's deputy defence minister Zeev Boim said.
</S><S s_id="3">
Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom echoed the accusations and told army radio: "Al-Qaeda threatens all the countries, including Arab ones that according to it have close relations with Israel or the Western world."
</S><S s_id="4">
"This would explain the recent attacks in Morocco, Istanbul or Riyadh," Shalom said of a series of deadly bombings in those cities.
</S><S s_id="5">
"The struggle against terrorism is worldwide and we are far from having won it because organisations, not States, are behind it."
</S><S s_id="6">
The attacks occurred late Thursday as the Red Sea coast of the southern Sinai was packed with Israeli holidaymakers celebrating the final day of the Jewish festival of Sukkot.
</S><S s_id="7">
Earlier this month Al-Qaeda number two Ayman al-Zawahiri called on young Muslims to attack Israeli, Western and Asian interests across the world, specifically mentioning Egypt.
</S><S s_id="8">
"It's the era of Muslim resistance, after the (Arab) governments submitted to the Zionist occupant.
</S><S s_id="9">
We should learn the lesson of Chechnya, Afghanistan, of Iraq, of Palestine," a voice attributed to Zawahiri said on a tape aired by Al-Jazeera on October 1.
</S><S s_id="10">
"Don't wait for the American, British, French, South Korean, Hungarian and Polish forces to enter Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, Yemen and Algeria to start the resistance," the speaker added.
</S><S s_id="11">
"We should start the resistance from now."
</S><S s_id="12">
Zawahiri, a 53-year-old Egyptian surgeon, is bin Laden's right-hand man and reportedly his personal physician.
</S><S s_id="13">
He was last heard in a videotape broadcast by the Qatar-based news channel on September 9 in which he forecast a US defeat in Iraq and Afghanistan, and there had been unconfirmed rumours that he may have been killed.
</S><S s_id="14">
But a US intelligence official said then that CIA analysts had concluded that the voice on the October 1 broadcast was indeed that of Zawahiri.

Explosion tears through resort in Sinai Peninsula where Israelis

Explosion tears through resort in Sinai Peninsula where Israelis
vacationing; Egypt says at least 30 killed
</S><S s_id="1">
A car bomb and a suicide bomber set off twin blasts that tore through a resort hotel in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula where Israelis were vacationing at the end of a Jewish holiday Thursday night, killing at least 30 people and wounding more than 160, officials said.
</S><S s_id="2">
Egypt said at least 30 people were killed _ including 12 Egyptians _ but an Israeli official later said he could confirm only 14 or 15 dead, including five or six Israelis.
</S><S s_id="3">
He said, however, that more were buried under the rubble.
</S><S s_id="4">
Israel Radio reported at least 35 people were killed.
</S><S s_id="5">
The explosion was followed by two smaller blasts at other tourist sites in the Sinai that killed at least two Israelis.
</S><S s_id="6">
Egyptian hospital officials said four people were killed in those explosions.
</S><S s_id="7">
Two bombs exploded in quick succession at the Taba Hilton.
</S><S s_id="8">
A car laden with explosives drove into the lobby of the hotel and detonated, while a suicide bomber blew up near the hotel swimming pool, the Israeli official said on condition of anonymity.
</S><S s_id="9">
Egyptian officials were investigating the blasts, but could not confirm witness reports that car bombs caused all three.
</S><S s_id="10">
The Taba blast collapsed a 10-story wing of the luxury Hilton hotel built by Israel when it controlled Taba from 1967 to 1989.
</S><S s_id="11">
Israelis described a chaotic scene as the explosion brought the top floors of the hotel crashing into the lobby.
</S><S s_id="12">
Meir Frajun said his three children were playing one floor below the lobby when the blast tore through the building.
</S><S s_id="13">
He went down but found only two of them.
</S><S s_id="14">
"Everything was filled with smoke," Frajun told The Associated Press after crossing into the nearby Israeli resort of Eilat.
</S><S s_id="15">
"We were hysterically looking for the child.
</S><S s_id="16">
In the end we found him sitting outside with an Arab guest of the hotel."
</S><S s_id="17">
Four hours after the blast, Israel's military took command of the scene, according to the army spokeswoman, Brig.
</S><S s_id="18">
Gen. Ruth Yaron, but there were delays in sending Israeli forces and rescue workers across the tense border.
</S><S s_id="19">
The explosions came a month after the Israeli government urged citizens not to visit Egypt, citing a "concrete" terror threat to tourists in an area.
</S><S s_id="20">
The warning, issued Sept. 9 by the counterterrorism center in Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's office, identified the Sinai Peninsula as the target of a potential attack.
</S><S s_id="21">
The initial blast, about 10 p.m., rocked the Hilton hotel in the Taba resort, only yards from the Israeli border.
</S><S s_id="22">
"The whole front of the hotel has collapsed.
</S><S s_id="23">
There are dozens of people on the floor, lots of blood," witness Yigal Vakni told Army Radio.
</S><S s_id="24">
Others were trapped in the debris, and the Israeli official said rescuers expected to find at least 10 more bodies.
</S><S s_id="25">
Just before midnight, two smaller blasts struck the area of Ras Shitan, a camping area near the town of Nuweiba south of Taba, witnesses said.
</S><S s_id="26">
Amsalem Farrag, whose uncle and cousin own camps in Ras Shitan, said both told him that cars exploded outside their camps.
</S><S s_id="27">
The two blasts were only five seconds apart, he said.
</S><S s_id="28">
He said the camps were full of vacationing Israelis.
</S><S s_id="29">
No established groups have claimed responsibility for the bombing, but two previously unknown groups each said they carried it out.
</S><S s_id="30">
Tawhid Islamic Brigades published a claim on a Web site that has been used frequently for such claims from Saudi Arabia and Iraq.
</S><S s_id="31">
And Jamaa Al-Islamiya Al-Alamiya, or World Islamist Group, called an international news agency in Jerusalem.
</S><S s_id="32">
Neither group offered detail of how it carried out the attack, as such claims usually do, and there was no way to confirm their authenticity.
</S><S s_id="33">
Egyptian government spokesman Magdy Rady suggested the blasts were related to the Israeli military operation against the Palestinians in the neighboring Gaza Strip, where 84 Palestinians have been killed in an Israeli offensive that began on Sept. 29 to stop militants from firing homemade rockets into Israel.
</S><S s_id="34">
"I think the explosions are very related to what is going on in Gaza," Rady told AP.
</S><S s_id="35">
"We condemn these attacks, which have harmed many people."
</S><S s_id="36">
"I think it is very probable that there is a link between these three explosions," he added.
</S><S s_id="37">
"It is very unlikely they happened by chance."
</S><S s_id="38">
The security adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Jibril Rajoub, told Al-Jazeera television that no Palestinian factions were responsible for the explosions.
</S><S s_id="39">
Egypt upgraded a security alert at the airports in Cairo and in the southern tourist cities of Luxor, Hurghada and Aswan.
</S><S s_id="40">
Police were searching cars coming in and out of Luxor and Hurghada and there was a heavy police presence around hotels.
</S><S s_id="41">
Yaron, the Israeli army spokeswoman, said Israeli Brig.
</S><S s_id="42">
Gen. Efi Idan "took command over the event in Taba" four hours after the blast.
</S><S s_id="43">
She said, however, "We still have some trouble in sending over all of the forces and their equipment to Taba."
</S><S s_id="44">
An Israeli foreign ministry spokeswoman said that Israel would help evacuate any of the 12,000 to 15,000 Israelis who wish to leave the Sinai.
</S><S s_id="45">
Friday morning, thousands were streaming into Eilat, across the border.
</S><S s_id="46">
Israel set up temporary accomodations in community centers, and Israeli radio reported a nationwide call for surgeons to get to Eilat.
</S><S s_id="47">
Israel's Army Radio reported that initially, Egyptian policemen fired in the air at the Taba border crossing as dozens of Israelis tried to break through to get home.
</S><S s_id="48">
Reporters from the Israeli side were unable to reach the scene, and no TV images were available several hours after the blast.
</S><S s_id="49">
More than 100 rescue workers, many wearing hard hats, were later allowed to cross, and graders were seen clearing rubble at the site.
</S><S s_id="50">
Egyptians reportedly allowed the teams in after Sharon instructed his diplomats to contact the Egyptians and expedite the crossing.
</S><S s_id="51">
The two countries signed a peace treaty in 1979, but relations have been chilly as a result of Israeli military actions in Palestinian areas.
</S><S s_id="52">
Rady said at least 30 people were killed and 160 injured in the Taba blast, and another seven Egyptians were injured in the Ras Shitan explosions.
</S><S s_id="53">
Israel's rescue service said it evacuated 108 casualties to Israel, including one dead and 48 in serious condition.
</S><S s_id="54">
An official at Taba Hospital, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said his institution had taken in 25 bodies from the Taba explosion and two more from Ras Shitan.
</S><S s_id="55">
An official at the Nuweiba hospital said two more bodies arrived there.
</S><S s_id="56">
Taba is the main crossing between Israel and Egypt and the gateway for thousands of Israelis who travel to the hotels and resorts on the Red Sea.
</S><S s_id="57">
Thursday was the last day of the weeklong Jewish festival of Sukkot, when thousands of Israelis vacation in the Sinai.
</S><S s_id="58">
Egyptians also were in the midst of a long holiday weekend marking the anniversary of the start of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, so popular resort towns along the Sinai coast were packed.
</S><S s_id="59">
Egypt has long struggled with Islamic militants interested in overthrowing the secular government, but has contained the threat with periodic crackdowns and by allowing Islamists some political activity.
</S><S s_id="60">
The last major militant strike in Egypt was the 1997 massacre of 58 foreign tourists by Islamic extremists in the southern resort town of Luxor.
</S><S s_id="61">
Rady said the explosions are sure to have a negative effect _ at least temporarily _ on Egypt's tourism industry, one of the country's economic mainstays.
</S><S s_id="62">
"There will be damage definitely to the tourism in the area," he said, "but I hope it will not last long."

Blast at Egyptian Resort Kills 30
</S><S s_id="1">
A massive explosion tore off the front of a seaside hotel in the Egyptian resort of Taba late Thursday, killing at least 30 people and injuring more than 100 in what appeared to be a terrorist attack aimed at Israeli tourists, officials said.
</S><S s_id="2">
The blast occurred at 10 p.m. at the Taba Hilton, a luxury high-rise hotel on the Red Sea surrounded by palm trees and coral reefs, just a few hundred yards over the border from the southern tip of Israel.
</S><S s_id="3">
The hotel, a popular venue for Middle East peace negotiators, was reportedly packed with Israeli tourists celebrating the end of the Jewish holiday of Sukkot.
</S><S s_id="4">
News service accounts from the area said two more explosions subsequently rocked the Red Sea resorts of Ras Shytan and Nuweiba, about 40 miles south of Taba, but details were sketchy.
</S><S s_id="5">
One witness interviewed by Israeli television reported that two rockets were fired at his hotel in Ras Shytan; another said there was a huge blast that appeared to be from a car bomb.
</S><S s_id="6">
Egyptian hospital officials cited by the Associated Press said four were killed in the two attacks.
</S><S s_id="7">
At the Hilton, witnesses described scenes of horror and pandemonium when a huge blast occurred at the front of the hotel, catapulting bodies across the spacious lobby area, which has a large bar, a casino and huge plate-glass windows looking out on a large salt-water pool nestled along the Red Sea.
</S><S s_id="8">
There were reports of large fires burning inside the hotel and people trapped under fallen debris.
</S><S s_id="9">
The Associated Press reported that an entire 10-floor wing collapsed.
</S><S s_id="10">
There were no official reports about the cause of the blast, but based on accounts from the scene and the extent of the damage, suspicion immediately focused on a possible car bomb detonated at the front of the building.
</S><S s_id="11">
"The whole front of the hotel has collapsed.
</S><S s_id="12">
There are dozens of people on the floor, lots of blood," said Yigal Vakni, an Israeli tourist interviewed by Israel's Army Radio.
</S><S s_id="13">
"I am standing outside the hotel -- the whole thing is burning and they have nothing to put it out with."
</S><S s_id="14">
"I was in my room on the fourth floor when suddenly I heard a tremendous explosion," a tourist identified only as Shimon told the Israeli Internet site Ynet.
</S><S s_id="15">
"The explosion was in the entrance of the hotel, where the cars stop to drop off suitcases.
</S><S s_id="16">
All the glass flew everywhere.
</S><S s_id="17">
I saw a lot of injured people, at least two dead people next to the swimming pool."
</S><S s_id="18">
Svetlana Ahmedallah, 33, said that she was in a room with her mother on the seventh floor when the blast occurred and that the building seemed to collapse.
</S><S s_id="19">
The next thing she knew, Ahmedallah said, she was on the ground.
</S><S s_id="20">
"I was lying in bed and my mother was in the bathroom when suddenly there was a strong explosion.
</S><S s_id="21">
Everything flew, and I heard my mother shouting for help," Ahmedallah said.
</S><S s_id="22">
She said she and her mother were in Taba on a two-week vacation from their home in Tatarstan in Russia.
</S><S s_id="23">
Ahmedallah, interviewed at a hospital just across the border from Egypt in Elat, where she was treated for minor injuries, said she apparently flew through a window.
</S><S s_id="24">
She did not know what happened to her mother, but said she assumed her mother had died.
</S><S s_id="25">
"I fell down to the ground on the bed.
</S><S s_id="26">
The whole part of the building collapsed.
</S><S s_id="27">
I don't know what happened."
</S><S s_id="28">
Egyptian officials said they had no evidence of terrorism, the Associated Press reported.
</S><S s_id="29">
Egyptian security officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the explosion occurred among gas tanks in the hotel kitchen, which is next to the casino, where many tourists were at the time.
</S><S s_id="30">
Egypt put the death toll at 30, and the Interior Ministry said 12 Egyptians were among the dead.
</S><S s_id="31">
Israel Radio reported Friday that at least 35 people were killed.
</S><S s_id="32">
After the explosion in Taba, many Israelis reportedly dropped everything and fled about 300 yards north to the official Israel-Egypt border crossing.
</S><S s_id="33">
Israeli officials said that after a period of confusion, Egyptian authorities began cooperating with Israeli fire and rescue personnel, allowing ambulances to cross the border to evacuate the wounded and search for those who remained trapped in the debris.
</S><S s_id="34">
Moshe Moshiko, a fire department spokesman in Elat, said 30 firefighters were allowed to cross into Egypt to help, but others were turned away because they did not have their passports.
</S><S s_id="35">
"They are trying to put out the fire and save people who are still trapped in the ruins of the hotel," he told Israel's Channel 10 television.
</S><S s_id="36">
"The firefighters are climbing up through the hotel, floor by floor, to save the people inside."
</S><S s_id="37">
Gideon Meir, a senior official in Israel's Foreign Ministry, said that in conversations with the Egyptian government, Israel had requested that Egypt permit free passage across the border for Israeli citizens and rescue personnel without passports, clearance for Israeli helicopters to fly to the scene of the attacks and permission for as many as 30 buses to travel down the coast to pick up any Israelis who wanted to leave.
</S><S s_id="38">
The Egyptians responded that they would do "their utmost" to help, he said.
</S><S s_id="39">
The Israel Defense Forces later took control of the scene at Taba.
</S><S s_id="40">
A military convoy including seven ambulances and three buses went to the site in Nuweiba.
</S><S s_id="41">
Last month, before the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah, the Foreign Ministry issued a travel advisory warning Israeli tourists not to travel to the Sinai Peninsula because of possible terrorist attacks.
</S><S s_id="42">
But officials said they believed that between 12,000 and 15,000 Israeli tourists were in the Sinai on Thursday.
</S><S s_id="43">
Israeli officials said they had no concrete information about who was behind the strikes.
</S><S s_id="44">
But one senior government official noted the similarities between Thursday's attacks and previous attacks by al-Qaida.
</S><S s_id="45">
He cited in particular the multiple simultaneous strikes in other countries.
</S><S s_id="46">
"It looks like al-Qaida," he said.
</S><S s_id="47">
"The characteristics of this attack are the same as Bali, Kenya, or even Madrid."
</S><S s_id="48">
No established groups have asserted responsibility for the bombing, but two previously unknown Islamic groups each said they carried it out.
</S><S s_id="49">
There was no way to confirm the authenticity of the claims.
</S><S s_id="50">
Elat is one of Israel's most popular resorts, located at the very southern tip of the country where Israel, Egypt and Jordan converge at the end of a small finger of the Red Sea.
</S><S s_id="51">
Joseftal Hospital there was inundated with wounded, said Naomi Halevy, a spokeswoman.
</S><S s_id="52">
"More people are coming in every minute," she said in a telephone interview.
</S><S s_id="53">
"It's a total mess."
</S><S s_id="54">
Hospital officials reported receiving 112 injured.
</S><S s_id="55">
There were few reliable reports about the other blasts.
</S><S s_id="56">
Assaf Levy, a tourist who was staying at the Castle Beach Hotel in Ras Shytan, said he was relaxing with friends when suddenly a missile was fired from the long, high mountain range that runs along much of the coast.
</S><S s_id="57">
"There was fire, a huge explosion, and we all ran outside," he told Israel's Channel 2.
</S><S s_id="58">
"Two minutes later we saw another missile that fell in the parking lot of the Castle Beach.
</S><S s_id="59">
Some people even ran towards the water and got into the sea because they were afraid of the missiles."
</S><S s_id="60">
Aya Reich, 28, a lawyer from Tel Aviv, said she was dining with about 10 friends at a small beach community called Moon Island when "suddenly there was a strong explosion about 30 meters away from us, and everyone flew, and then a minute later there was another explosion, and we all started running towards the water."
</S><S s_id="61">
"People were falling on top of each other," said Reich, who was wounded in the foot by shrapnel.
</S><S s_id="62">
"Everyone was hysterical."

Egyptian and Israeli rescue workers picked through the ruins of a luxury Sinai hotel Friday after at least 27 people were killed in bomb attacks on Thursday night that shook the hotel and two others popular with vacationing Israelis.
</S><S s_id="2">
Israeli officials said they believed the blasts, in which more than 100 were wounded, were caused by terrorist bombs.
</S><S s_id="3">
The workers from the two countries labored side by side at the ruins of the the hotel, the Taba Hilton, using heavy earthmoving equipment, their bare hands, and rope to pull apart the rubble, and enlisting sniffer dogs in a retrieval effort or to search for any remaining victims.
</S><S s_id="4">
The two other blasts took place to the southwest, in the resort villages of Ras al-Sultan and Nuweiba.
</S><S s_id="5">
A coordinator of the Israeli rescue efforts, Col. Gidon Baron, said that the bodies of some of the 27 people he confirmed were killed had been retrieved from the rubble of the hotel Friday.
</S><S s_id="6">
An Egyptian doctor at the Taba hospital, Wael Nahran, said 22 bodies had been taken to the hospital's morgue.
</S><S s_id="7">
A previously unknown pro-al Qaida Islamist group called Islamic Tawhid Brigades claimed responsibility for the blast on a Web site, a Reuters report said.
</S><S s_id="8">
The claim, along with one from another unknown group calling itself the World Islamist Group, could not be verified.
</S><S s_id="9">
Agence France-Presse reported that someone claiming to be from World Islamist Group had taken responsibility for the Hilton blast in a telephone call to its bureau in Jerusalem.
</S><S s_id="10">
The caller said the attack was "in revenge for the Palestinian and Arab martyrs dying in Palestine and Iraq," the agency reported.
</S><S s_id="11">
Israel's deputy defense minister, Zeev Boim, told reporters the attack appeared to be the work of "international terror groups like al-Qaida or branches of it," according to Reuters.
</S><S s_id="12">
The largest explosion was at the Taba Hilton, where early reports suggested that a truck bomb was driven into the hotel, located in a village just across the border and near the Israeli town of Eilat.
</S><S s_id="13">
Israel Radio said Friday morning that officials thought there was also a suicide bomber in the Hilton.
</S><S s_id="14">
The hotel was badly damaged by the blast and an ensuing fire, and 10 floors in the complex collapsed.
</S><S s_id="15">
Part of the Hilton apparently crumbled immediately after the blast.
</S><S s_id="16">
"I heard a huge explosion," said Yigal Vakni, an Israeli at the Hilton who spoke to Israeli Army Radio.
</S><S s_id="17">
"The wall near me collapsed and people began to run."
</S><S s_id="18">
The blast was outside, he said.
</S><S s_id="19">
"When we went out we saw the shops and the internal wall of the hotel had collapsed."
</S><S s_id="20">
Many people were lying on the ground, he said, "There is a lot of blood, a lot of screaming."
</S><S s_id="21">
An unnamed Israeli woman told Israeli television: "We immediately ran toward the beach, everyone running at once, and windows continue to shatter as we ran away.
</S><S s_id="22">
Entire families were wounded; they ran to the beach and were covered with blood."
</S><S s_id="23">
An Israeli tourist, Gal Keshet, who said he took part in the rescue at Ras al-Sultan, said that one vehicle exploded after it breached the resort, while another car did not manage to get in but blew up anyway, without causing casualties.
</S><S s_id="24">
Last month, Israeli intelligence warned Israelis to keep out of the Sinai desert, citing vague but solid information about possible attacks.
</S><S s_id="25">
Panicked Israelis rushed the border post, trying to flee Egypt, yelling at the border guards in Arabic that their belongings and documents were still in the burning hotel.
</S><S s_id="26">
Guards fired shots into the air to try to disperse them, before finally shutting the terminal temporarily.
</S><S s_id="27">
Roads were blocked, leaving vacationing Israelis at other hotels trapped.
</S><S s_id="28">
Hadas Manor, an Israeli journalist staying at another Taba hotel, told Israeli television: "Most of the people here haven't come with their cars, so they depend on Egyptian taxis that are not operating now."
</S><S s_id="29">
Television broadcasts of the border showed an Arab Israeli woman being carried by her husband.
</S><S s_id="30">
As he put her down, she collapsed, and medics rushed to her.
</S><S s_id="31">
Israeli television also showed scenes of ambulances arriving at Eilat hospitals and unloading the wounded, many of them bandaged and bloody.
</S><S s_id="32">
Others, apparently in shock, were wheeled in on stretchers.
</S><S s_id="33">
Israeli television interviewed a man, identified as Yaniv, who described the blast near Ras al-Sultan.
</S><S s_id="34">
"We were sitting in a restaurant and suddenly heard a very powerful blast," the man said.
</S><S s_id="35">
"The electricity went out and rocks were jolted by the blast," he added.
</S><S s_id="36">
"We then saw a second explosion not far from the first blast; it was a ball of fire higher on the mountain.
</S><S s_id="37">
We immediately drove over to the site and found wounded people on the ground, there were Israelis among them, they were bleeding in the sand and there was no one there to help them."
</S><S s_id="38">
The warning about possible attacks came in an unusual public alert from Avi Dichter, head of the Shin Bet intelligence service, not to go to Sinai resorts during the harvest festival season of Sukkot, which began last week.
</S><S s_id="39">
He said there was intelligence about a possible attack against Israeli tourists in Egypt's Sinai, where as many as 12,000 Israelis were traveling for the holidays, according to the Israeli Foreign Ministry.
</S><S s_id="40">
Since his warning, Israel has moved in force into the Gaza Strip that borders Egypt, trying to stop militant Palestinians like Hamas and Islamic Jihad from firing rockets into Israel.
</S><S s_id="41">
But Israeli officials suggested that an attack of this magnitude would have been planned carefully from within Egypt and was not tied to the Gaza operation.
</S><S s_id="42">
Hamas, which has improving relations with Cairo, may not want to embarrass Egypt in this way, said Oded Granot, an Israeli commentator on Arab affairs.
</S><S s_id="43">
He suggested that al-Qaida, an offshoot of the group or an Egyptian radical group might be responsible.
</S><S s_id="44">
In November 2002, attackers drove a car bomb into a hotel popular with Israelis in Mombasa, Kenya, killing 13, and fired missiles at an Israeli charter jet, but missed the target.
</S><S s_id="45">
Israeli officials speculated Thursday night that militants, finding it increasingly hard to attack Israelis in Israel, are choosing to attack them abroad.
</S><S s_id="46">
They may also be trying to cause strains between Israel and Egypt, which are trying to cooperate on the Israeli government plan for a withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.
</S><S s_id="47">
Israel also regularly complains that Egypt should do more to stop the smuggling of arms into Gaza and that Cairo does not take its security responsibilities seriously enough.
</S><S s_id="48">
The Egyptians say that Israel would best protect itself by making serious progress toward peace with the Palestinians, rather than by accelerating the cycle of violence.
</S><S s_id="49">
But Egypt will not want the Israeli-Palestinian struggle to spill across the border and is expected by Israeli officials to move quickly to try to track down those responsible.
</S><S s_id="50">
The attacks may also be intended to damage Egypt's tourism industry, on which it depends heavily.
</S><S s_id="51">
In 1997, after militants attacked tourists in Luxor and killed nearly 70 people, Egypt cracked down hard on Islamic Jihad.
</S><S s_id="52">
The Egyptian government at first suggested the Hilton explosion was caused by gas canisters and initially prevented Israeli rescue workers without passports from crossing the border to the hotel.
</S><S s_id="53">
The Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, spoke with the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, and persuaded him to allow Israeli rescue workers to the scene without delay.
</S><S s_id="54">
Yuval Steinitz, chairman of Parliament's foreign and defense committee, said: "What is sad is the fact that over recent months we have received incessant warnings concerning a possible attack in Sinai, and these warnings grew more and more clear, but the public failed to listen."
</S><S s_id="55">
Taba is a small village dominated by the Hilton, originally built by the Israelis.
</S><S s_id="56">
Israel returned the Sinai to Egypt in 1982 but claimed that Taba was inside Israel according to the international border.
</S><S s_id="57">
International arbitrators disagreed, and Israel returned Taba, along with the expensive hotel, to Egypt in March 1989.
</S><S s_id="58">
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have met numerous times at the hotel for peace talks.
</S><S s_id="59">
Witnesses told similar stories of the attacks.
</S><S s_id="60">
Hassan Elkhin told Israeli Channel 10: "After the blast, parts of the wall and ceiling began to crumble.
</S><S s_id="61">
I ran to look for my friends and found them downstairs in the casino.
</S><S s_id="62">
I pulled them out and we managed to leave the hotel.
</S><S s_id="63">
The walls around us collapsed, and there was fire around."
</S><S s_id="64">
Standing outside the hotel, he said, "we watched as the rooms disappeared, they collapsed one after the other."
</S><S s_id="65">
When asked if he wasn't afraid to travel to Sinai, Elkhin said: "I heard the alerts and warnings, but I never believed anything could ever happen there, because, after all, every one there is Israeli.
</S><S s_id="66">
"Still," he said, "it happened."

12 killed, 135 injured in Sinai blasts: Egypt's Interior Ministry
</S><S s_id="1">
At least 12 people were killed and 135 others injured in three blasts that targeted tourist resorts in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, the Interior Ministry said in a statement early Friday.
</S><S s_id="2">
Most of the victims were Israelis.
</S><S s_id="3">
The explosions came one month after the Israeli government urged citizens not to visit Egypt, citing a terror threat to tourists in the area.
</S><S s_id="4">
The warning, issued on Sept. 9 by the counter-terrorism center of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's office, identified Sinai as the target of a potential attack.
</S><S s_id="5">
A huge car-bombing rocked the Hilton hotel in Egypt's Red Sea resort of Taba late Thursday.
</S><S s_id="6">
The explosion was followed by two smaller blasts at resort towns of Nuwaiba and Ras al-Sultan in Sinai, dozens of kilometers southwest of Taba.
