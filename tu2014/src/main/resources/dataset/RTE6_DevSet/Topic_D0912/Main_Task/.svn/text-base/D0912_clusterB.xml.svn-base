Peace Mom's Protest Riles Gun-Toting Neighbor
</S><S s_id="1">
Undaunted by counter rallies and even a neighbor's gunshot blasts into the air, a woman whose son died in Iraq said she will continue her anti-war demonstration near President George W. Bush's ranch for three more weeks.
</S><S s_id="2">
"We can't give up, no matter hard it gets," Cindy Sheehan said Sunday.
</S><S s_id="3">
She started the protest Aug. 6 in memory of her 24-year-old son Casey, an Army specialist killed in Iraq last year.
</S><S s_id="4">
Her makeshift campsite along the road leading to the Western White House has grown to more than 100, and hundreds more have stopped by for a few hours to show their support.
</S><S s_id="5">
Sheehan says she won't leave "Camp Casey" until Bush meets with her and other grieving families or until his monthlong ranch visit ends.
</S><S s_id="6">
More than 350 war protesters rallied at the site Saturday afternoon, hours after some 250 Bush supporters waved American flags in a counter rally across the street, holding signs that said Sheehan was unpatriotic and was hurting troop morale.
</S><S s_id="7">
While about 60 in Sheehan's group held a religious service Sunday morning, a nearby landowner, Larry Mattlage, fired his shotgun twice into the air.
</S><S s_id="8">
Sheriff's deputies and Secret Service agents rushed to his house but did not arrest him.
</S><S s_id="9">
"I ain't threatening nobody, and I ain't pointing a gun at nobody," Mattlage said.
</S><S s_id="10">
"This is Texas."
</S><S s_id="11">
Mattlage said he was initially sympathetic toward the demonstrators, but that they have blocked roads in the area and caused traffic problems.
</S><S s_id="12">
He said he fired his gun in preparation for the dove-hunting season, but when asked if he had another motive, he said, "Figure it out for yourself."
</S><S s_id="13">
Sheriff's deputies have kept a presence at the demonstrators' site, and more than a dozen law enforcement cars flanked the edge of the camp Saturday to keep them and the pro-Bush rally separated.
</S><S s_id="14">
A few from each side got into heated verbal exchanges, but no one was arrested.
</S><S s_id="15">
Sheehan, 48, of Vacaville, California, said she was not concerned with her own safety but that she has told others to be aware that "this could get physical, even though we are peaceful."
</S><S s_id="16">
"I think we knew of the risks when we came down here," she said.
</S><S s_id="17">
"I'm surprised we haven't had more of that since we're in Bush country."
</S><S s_id="18">
Sheehan, who met with two top Bush administration officials on her first day of the protest, said some of her supporters have left the campsite but that others keep arriving from around the country.
</S><S s_id="19">
Bush has said he sympathizes with Sheehan but has not said if he will meet with her.
</S><S s_id="20">
Sherry Bohlen of Scottsdale, Arizona, drove with two friends to Crawford last week but didn't leave Sunday as planned.
</S><S s_id="21">
"This is history in the making, and it's hard to walk away from that," said Bohlen, whose son Thor has been in Iraq for a month.

Husband of woman publicly protesting death of son in Iraq files for divorce
</S><S s_id="1">
The husband of Cindy Sheehan, the mother camped outside President George Bush's Texas ranch to protest the death of a son in the Iraq war, has filed for divorce, according to court documents.
</S><S s_id="2">
Patrick Sheehan filed the divorce petition Friday in Solano County court, northeast of San Francisco.
</S><S s_id="3">
His lawyer did not immediately return a call seeking comment Monday.
</S><S s_id="4">
The couple's eldest child, Casey, 24, was an Army soldier killed in April 2004.
</S><S s_id="5">
Cindy Sheehan has said the stress of the death led to the separation of the couple, who were high school sweethearts.
</S><S s_id="6">
Sheehan has vowed to remain in Texas through Bush's August vacation, unless he meets with her.
</S><S s_id="7">
She began her protest 10 days ago and has since been joined by more than 100 anti-war activists.
</S><S s_id="8">
"Our message is to bring the troops home," Sheehan said Monday.
</S><S s_id="9">
The White House on Monday again issued a statement saying that Bush sympathizes with Sheehan.
</S><S s_id="10">
The president has given no indication that he will meet with her.
</S><S s_id="11">
Sheehan, 48, and other grieving military families met with Bush in June 2004 at Fort Lewis, near Seattle, two months after her son's death.
</S><S s_id="12">
But she says the meeting was unsatisfactory, and it came before reports surfaced about faulty pre-war intelligence, which enraged her.

Bush neighbor allows war protesters to camp on his land

Bush neighbor allows war protesters to camp on his land
</S><S s_id="1">
One of President George W. Bush's neighbors will allow use of his land by dozens of war protesters who have camped in roadside ditches the past 11 days, giving them more room and halving their distance from Bush's ranch.
</S><S s_id="2">
Fred Mattlage, an Army veteran, said he sympathizes with the demonstrators whose makeshift camp off the winding, two-lane road leading to Bush's ranch has angered most residents.
</S><S s_id="3">
Mattlage said the group will be safer on his corner 1-acre lot (0.4-hectare).
</S><S s_id="4">
"I just think people should have a right to protest without being harassed," Mattlage told The Associated Press Tuesday night.
</S><S s_id="5">
"And I'm against the war.
</S><S s_id="6">
I don't think it's a war we need to be in."
</S><S s_id="7">
Cindy Sheehan of Vacaville, California, started the vigil Aug. 6 to honor her son Casey, who was killed in Iraq last year.
</S><S s_id="8">
Sheehan has vowed to remain through Bush's monthlong ranch visit unless he meets with her and other grieving families.
</S><S s_id="9">
Mattlage's Monday night offer, accepted by protesters Tuesday, will put them about a mile from Bush's ranch, said Hadi Jawad of the Crawford Peace House, which is helping the group.
</S><S s_id="10">
Demonstrators said they would start moving their tents, anti-war banners and portable toilets to the new site Wednesday and hope to have the new camp set up in time for a dusk candlelight vigil.
</S><S s_id="11">
The vigil will be one of about 1,000 to be held across the country, an effort organized by liberal advocacy groups MoveOn.org Political Action, TrueMajority and Democracy for America.
</S><S s_id="12">
Larry Mattlage, a distant cousin of Mattlage's who owns nearby land, fired a shotgun twice into the air Sunday but no one was injured.
</S><S s_id="13">
But Fred Mattlage does not share his cousin's frustrations with the group.
</S><S s_id="14">
For more than a week, the rural area has been a traffic nightmare as the camp attracted hundreds more protesters as well as Bush supporters holding counter-rallies.
</S><S s_id="15">
A resident was arrested Monday night after authorities say he ran over hundreds of small wooden crosses bearing names of fallen U.S. soldiers.
</S><S s_id="16">
Tuesday morning, several landowners asked county commissioners to extend for at least two miles (3.2 kilometers) the public "no parking" zone around Bush's ranch.
</S><S s_id="17">
The ordinance now prohibits cars from stopping on the road within about a quarter of a mile.
</S><S s_id="18">
Bush, who said he sympathizes with Sheehan, has made no indication that he will meet with her.
</S><S s_id="19">
Sheehan and other families met with Bush two months after her son's death before she became a vocal opponent of the war.

Activists Protest the War, or Protest the Protesters

Activists Protest the War, or Protest the Protesters
</S><S s_id="1">
Barbara Cummings was home in San Diego last Monday, listening to an Air America radio broadcast, when she heard the tale of a woman who was coming here to join Cindy Sheehan in her growing protest against the war in Iraq.
</S><S s_id="2">
The woman on the radio had a son who had signed on for a second tour of duty in the Army after losing his job.
</S><S s_id="3">
In two weeks, he is scheduled to ship out to Iraq.
</S><S s_id="4">
Cummings jumped on the phone and called her friend, Gloria Polk.
</S><S s_id="5">
"I asked her, 'Are you following the Cindy Sheehan story?'
</S><S s_id="6">
And she was."
</S><S s_id="7">
The next day, the two retirees hopped in a rented minivan for the 22-hour drive to the heart of Texas.
</S><S s_id="8">
Saturday, Cummings found herself in front of the Crawford Peace House, a gathering place for protesters, holding a hand-lettered sign.
</S><S s_id="9">
She was directing a stream of cars descending on this normally sleepy town to a dirt parking lot adjacent to a nearby high school football field.
</S><S s_id="10">
Polk, meanwhile, was at the wheel of her blue Dodge Caravan, shuttling protesters up to the roadside campsite near President Bush's 1,600-acre ranch where Sheehan has been holding her defiant vigil for more than a week.
</S><S s_id="11">
"We're both here because of our grandchildren," Cummings explained.
</S><S s_id="12">
"It feels like a word-of-mouth thing.
</S><S s_id="13">
Everybody I meet is saying they had to be here."
</S><S s_id="14">
While the antiwar activists buzzed around the Peace House preparing for a scheduled rally, more than 150 flag-waving marchers made their way toward Sheehan's camp to show their support for the war.
</S><S s_id="15">
Also, a lone demonstrator drove a pickup truck blaring country music with a large American flag flying from its bed.
</S><S s_id="16">
A sign on his door read: "Texas Is Bush Country."
</S><S s_id="17">
James Vergauwen and his wife, Wynell, preferred to stay put next to their Harley to make their point.
</S><S s_id="18">
"I'm just here to let the president and the troops know that there are people here who do support them," said James Vergauwen, who wore a cap emblazoned "The price of freedom is not free."
</S><S s_id="19">
"I don't agree with the president about everything.
</S><S s_id="20">
I just wish Cindy Sheehan could spend one hour in the president's shoes making tough decisions."
</S><S s_id="21">
Several hundred antiwar protesters converged on Crawford this weekend, and many of them had similar stories.
</S><S s_id="22">
They believe that Sheehan, a 48-year-old mother from Vacaville, Calif., whose son was killed in Iraq last year, has magically ignited a struggling peace movement with her quiet, but defiant protest.
</S><S s_id="23">
"It's just a miracle what's going on here," said Bill Mitchell, who lost his son, Michael, in Iraq on April 4, 2004 -- the same day that Sheehan's son, Casey, was killed.
</S><S s_id="24">
Along with Sheehan, he has protested the war for more than a year and helped organize other military families in support of their cause.
</S><S s_id="25">
But often it seemed that no one cared.
</S><S s_id="26">
"We've worked so long and hard to get our message out," he said.
</S><S s_id="27">
Ray McGovern, a former intelligence official turned antiwar activist, came down from Virginia to support Sheehan.
</S><S s_id="28">
"I think Cindy has lit a spark where Americans can identify with the human costs of the war," he said.
</S><S s_id="29">
While Sheehan's protest has received the aid of public relations pros, political operatives and even a television spot since it started a week ago Saturday, many of the people drawn here said it was because of her simple but compelling story.
</S><S s_id="30">
Sheehan is the grieving mother of a fallen soldier and she wants the president to explain to her why.
</S><S s_id="31">
"I'm here just to support this lady and show there is support for getting out of Iraq and stopping this maniac from doing what he is doing," said Lawrence Reuben, a Vietnam veteran and a helicopter technician, from nearby Benton, Texas.
</S><S s_id="32">
"Why can't the president just stop and talk to the woman and say, 'Lady, I know where you're coming from.
</S><S s_id="33">
This war is not going the way I intended.'
</S><S s_id="34">
"
</S><S s_id="35">
At the Peace House, a small wood-frame cottage just across the railroad tracks from this town's only traffic signal, things were humming.
</S><S s_id="36">
Outside, the parents of fallen soldiers were doing interviews with reporters while volunteers prepared signs, sold T-shirts and buttons and offered food and water to protesters.
</S><S s_id="37">
Before Sheehan's arrival, the house, established in 2003 by Dallas peace activists, had $121 in the bank and its phone cut off because of overdue bills.
</S><S s_id="38">
But once word of Sheehan's protest took flight, money began to flow in.
</S><S s_id="39">
A woman from Italy paid for a large party tent, coolers and a generator.
</S><S s_id="40">
Other strangers sent checks and made deposits directly into the group's PayPal account.
</S><S s_id="41">
In one week, the house has amassed enough money to pay off its $40,000 mortgage.
</S><S s_id="42">
"I've been walking around with my mouth open and in a daze for the past two or three days," said Kay Lucas, the Peace House director.
</S><S s_id="43">
"It's a blessing, a miracle.
</S><S s_id="44">
It's like the parable of the loaves and the fishes.
</S><S s_id="45">
The money and the phone calls and the letters of support have all been phenomenal."
</S><S s_id="46">
Lucas said that the staff of the Peace House sent an e-mail to Sheehan once they learned that she planned to come to Crawford.
</S><S s_id="47">
Since her arrival, the house has been a sanctuary, a place for Sheehan and other protesters to take a nap, a shower or a break from the roadside camp.
</S><S s_id="48">
At Camp Casey, the name given to Sheehan's encampment, a caravan of cars drove by her as she stood wearing a straw hat in the blazing sun, fighting back tears as she acknowledged her supporters.
</S><S s_id="49">
She wore a T-shirt bearing her dead son's picture.
</S><S s_id="50">
On her left ankle was a small tattoo that read: Casey '79-04.
</S><S s_id="51">
Before long, she climbed onto the back of a pickup truck to address her supporters, who applauded loudly.
</S><S s_id="52">
She smiled humbly but her words were uncompromising.
</S><S s_id="53">
"Who knew that the beginning of the end of the occupation of Iraq was going to start in Crawford, Texas, last Saturday?" she said.
</S><S s_id="54">
"Who knew that America would finally stand up and say we're sick and tired of this (expletive)?
</S><S s_id="55">
Bring our troops home."

PINKERTON COMMENTARY: United In Their Desire to Cause Change

PINKERTON COMMENTARY: United In Their Desire to Cause Change
</S><S s_id="1">
Two women, both of whom have lost children, are out to change government policy.
</S><S s_id="2">
Can they succeed?
</S><S s_id="3">
Should they succeed?
</S><S s_id="4">
The two women are Beth Holloway Twitty and Cindy Sheehan.
</S><S s_id="5">
Twitty's daughter, Natalee Holloway, went missing in Aruba in May.
</S><S s_id="6">
Sheehan lost her son, Casey, in Iraq last year.
</S><S s_id="7">
Both women have proved savvy in using the media.
</S><S s_id="8">
And, although we must sympathize with both, we must also consider the impact of their efforts on the institutions that have been created to deal with problems of law and war.
</S><S s_id="9">
Twitty believes that Aruban authorities are not working energetically and competently to find out what happened to her daughter.
</S><S s_id="10">
In taking her case to the public, she has enlisted much of the media, particularly cable news.
</S><S s_id="11">
Yet, while many have criticized TV's infatuation with the Case of Yet Another Pretty White Girl, a deeper point needs to be remembered: the importance of victims' rights.
</S><S s_id="12">
For decades, even as the crime rate soared, the legal and popular culture chose to dwell on the sympathetic side of criminals -- that they, too, were victims of a racist and unjust society.
</S><S s_id="13">
Finally, law-abiding Middle America said, "Enough!"
</S><S s_id="14">
In the last two decades, tragic events have propelled such new figures as John "America's Most Wanted" Walsh into rightful prominence.
</S><S s_id="15">
Politicians have responded to this cultural shift by toughening laws, hiring more cops and increasing prison sentences.
</S><S s_id="16">
Yet there's obviously still more work to be done.
</S><S s_id="17">
The recent case of Joseph Edward Duncan -- charged with triple homicide and abduction of an 8-year-old girl -- demonstrates that the revolving door still spins out of control.
</S><S s_id="18">
Duncan was legally deemed a sexual psychopath in 1980.
</S><S s_id="19">
Yet, for much of the last quarter-century, he has been out of jail, free to do who knows what.
</S><S s_id="20">
It's apparent that even today many officials still calculate that it's not really worth worrying about catching criminals and keeping them caught.
</S><S s_id="21">
By this reckoning, the Natalie Holloway case should not be seen as the opportunity to exploit the memory of a telegenic blonde, but rather to change the lenient professional calculus of cops, judges and parole boards.
</S><S s_id="22">
Cindy Sheehan, too, wishes to use the media for her cause, getting the United States out of Iraq.
</S><S s_id="23">
After stumping the country for months in obscurity, she hit upon a media-friendly stratagem.
</S><S s_id="24">
She camped outside George W. Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas, where bored reporters were eager for a lively story.
</S><S s_id="25">
It's Sheehan's right to protest, and most likely her efforts will increase opposition to the war; every movement, to be effective in the media age, needs a face.
</S><S s_id="26">
And now the anti-war movement has its face.
</S><S s_id="27">
But it's worth pausing over the one specific request Sheehan has made: that the president meet with her to talk about Iraq.
</S><S s_id="28">
Were Bush to do so, it would set a bad precedent.
</S><S s_id="29">
Without regard to the merits of this particular war, a president should not be media-blackmailed into such a meeting.
</S><S s_id="30">
During World War II, some 400,000 Americans were killed, and so should President Franklin D. Roosevelt have met with each one of those families?
</S><S s_id="31">
In wartime, we need a commander in chief, not a consoler in chief or a debater in chief.
</S><S s_id="32">
It's possible that Bush policies will be overturned at the ballot box in the coming elections.
</S><S s_id="33">
If so, that would be an example of the system responding legitimately to public pressure.
</S><S s_id="34">
What connects Twitty and Sheehan is that they want to make change.
</S><S s_id="35">
What will validate their efforts permanently is if they make change that strengthens useful institutions as opposed to weakening them.
</S><S s_id="36">
That means forcing the criminal justice system to do its job, on the one hand, while leaving Bush and the electorate to do their jobs on the other.

Conservative Backlash Aimed at Antiwar Protester Sheehan

Conservative Backlash Aimed at Antiwar Protester Sheehan
</S><S s_id="1">
Cindy Sheehan rode into town 10 days ago, a forlorn mother with a penetrating question for her president: Why did my son die in Iraq?
</S><S s_id="2">
But now the same wave of publicity and political anger that she rode to become a nationally known symbol of the antiwar movement threatens to crash down on Sheehan herself.
</S><S s_id="3">
Conservative commentators and Web sites are taking aim at Sheehan with the same ferocity she has aimed at President Bush.
</S><S s_id="4">
In part, they are using her own words as ammunition against her -- reciting such controversial comments as her vow to refuse pay taxes to a government waging an "illegal" war and her desire to see Bush impeached.
</S><S s_id="5">
The backlash is becoming a new object lesson in how saturation media coverage and the instinct for personal attack are shaping political debate.
</S><S s_id="6">
Some independent commentators said the pushback on the right had succeeded in part at scuffing the public sympathy and deference she had earned as the mother of a fallen soldier, and shown how virtually any subject relating to the Iraq war and Bush's presidency is viewed through a partisan lens.
</S><S s_id="7">
"Cindy Sheehan has emboldened the progressives who oppose the war and caused the conservative die-hards who are behind the war to go into a defensive mode," said Michael Harrison, publisher of Talkers magazine, a trade publication for talk radio.
</S><S s_id="8">
"Cindy Sheehan is going to be a target, and they'll probably go through her past to find what they can to discredit her."
</S><S s_id="9">
Since her son, Casey, 24, was killed in Iraq last year, Sheehan has traveled the country trying to drum up opposition to the war in Iraq.
</S><S s_id="10">
She has participated in peace conferences, demonstrations and a mock congressional hearing about the infamous Downing Street memo, notes of a meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his top advisers that said the Bush administration had decided to go to war and molded intelligence findings to support that decision.
</S><S s_id="11">
In that time, Sheehan, 48, a soft-spoken woman who says she was radicalized by her son's death, has engaged in her fair share of inflammatory rhetoric.
</S><S s_id="12">
"It's obvious Cindy Sheehan has become a political player, whose primary concern is embarrassing the president," Fox Television personality Bill O'Reilly wrote Tuesday in an online column.
</S><S s_id="13">
"She is no longer just a protester."
</S><S s_id="14">
Bush, Sheehan said, lied to the American people about the war and should be impeached.
</S><S s_id="15">
And she is refusing to pay taxes in hopes that the Internal Revenue Service will come after her to collect.
</S><S s_id="16">
"I'm not supporting a government that wages an illegal, immoral war," she said.
</S><S s_id="17">
"I want them to come after me, so I can put the war on trial."
</S><S s_id="18">
Still, she called some of the statements attributed to her distortions.
</S><S s_id="19">
Contrary to a letter attributed to her that is circulating widely on the Internet, she claims she never said that the United States is waging the war in Iraq to protect Israel.
</S><S s_id="20">
"I have said a lot of strong things, and I'll stand by everything I said," Sheehan said, adding that she thought the document had been altered.
</S><S s_id="21">
"But I didn't say that."
</S><S s_id="22">
The scrutiny that has accompanied Sheehan's quick rise to prominence has extended to her family.
</S><S s_id="23">
Several of her in-laws have publicly criticized her protest -- announcing their displeasure in a release to the Drudge Report.
</S><S s_id="24">
And news that Sheehan's husband, Patrick, has filed for divorce has been trumpeted by some bloggers as evidence of her extreme views.
</S><S s_id="25">
Sheehan acknowledges that that some of her views are becoming a distraction.
</S><S s_id="26">
Also, she said, some of the groups that have aided her protest have agendas -- including conspiracy theories about the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and some vaguely anti-Semitic theories about the cause of the war -- that she says she does not share.
</S><S s_id="27">
Consequently, she has asked that her camp site near Bush's ranch be restricted only to organizations of military families, or those that have lost loved ones in the war.
</S><S s_id="28">
"Attention got focused on the messenger and not the message," Sheehan said.
</S><S s_id="29">
"My thing is ending the war in Iraq.
</S><S s_id="30">
But there are a lot of people who want to attach their horse to my wagon because of the exposure I'm getting."
</S><S s_id="31">
The increased scrutiny of Sheehan is coming as some residents here are growing irritated with the stream of antiwar protesters drawn to her vigil.
</S><S s_id="32">
A spokeswoman for Sheehan Tuesday announced plans to move the camp from the drainage ditches next to the winding road about two miles from Bush's 1,600-acre spread to a field on a ranch offered by one of Bush's neighbors.
</S><S s_id="33">
The new camp would be about a mile from Bush's ranch.
</S><S s_id="34">
All that would be left behind at the original site would be three tents and hundreds of white, wooden crosses bearing the names of troops killed in Iraq.
</S><S s_id="35">
The move followed complaints by about 60 of Bush's neighbors, who petitioned the county to expand a no-parking zone around the camp, in an effort to avert the traffic tie-ups that have become commonplace as the protest has grown.
</S><S s_id="36">
Also, Monday night a truck dragging chains and a pipe demolished some of the crosses.
</S><S s_id="37">
Sheehan has promised to remain encamped throughout Bush's five-week stay here and to return whenever the president does.
</S><S s_id="38">
She also announced plans for a series of nearly 1,000 candlelight vigils nationwide on Wednesday night.
</S><S s_id="39">
Liberal advocacy groups MoveOn.org Political Action and Democracy for America are organizing the protests.
</S><S s_id="40">
"All of this other b.s. just clouds my message," Sheehan said.
</S><S s_id="41">
"My message is that of a brokenhearted mom sitting down in front of George Bush's ranch wanting to know why my son died."

BUSH DEFENDS IGNORING PROTEST
</S><S s_id="1">
CRAWFORD, Texas - President Bush, noting that lots of people want to talk to the president and "it's also important for me to go on with my life," on Saturday defended his decision not to meet with the grieving mom of a soldier killed in Iraq.
</S><S s_id="2">
Bush said he is aware of the anti-war sentiments of Cindy Sheehan and others who have joined her protest near the Bush ranch.

"But whether it be here or in Washington or anywhere else, there's somebody who has got something to say to the president, that's part of the job," Bush said on the ranch.
</S><S s_id="4">
"And I think it's important for me to be thoughtful and sensitive to those who have got something to say."
</S><S s_id="5">
"But," he added, "I think it's also important for me to go on with my life, to keep a balanced life."
</S><S s_id="6">
The comments came prior to a bike ride on the ranch with journalists and aides.
</S><S s_id="7">
It also came as the crowd of protesters grew in support of Sheehan, the California mother who came here Aug. 6 demanding to talk to Bush about the death of her son Casey.
</S><S s_id="8">
Sheehan arrived earlier in the week with about a half dozen supporters.
</S><S s_id="9">
As of yesterday (Saturday) there were about 300 anti-war protestors and approximately 100 people supporting the Bush Administration.
</S><S s_id="10">
Sheehan is seeking a justification for the war, as well as her son's death.
</S><S s_id="11">
"I don't want comfort from him," she said Friday.
</S><S s_id="12">
""I want answers.
</S><S s_id="13">
I want the truth."
</S><S s_id="14">
Bush on Saturday said, "I've heard their complaints about my policy.
</S><S s_id="15">
I think it would be a big mistake to withdraw immediately from Iraq, which is what they're suggesting we do."
</S><S s_id="16">
In addition to the two-hour bike ride, Bush's Saturday schedule included an evening Little League Baseball playoff game, a lunch meeting with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, a nap, some fishing and some reading.
</S><S s_id="17">
"I think the people want the president to be in a position to make good, crisp decisions and to stay healthy," he said when asked about bike riding while a grieving mom wanted to speak with him.
</S><S s_id="18">
"And part of my being is to be outside exercising."
</S><S s_id="19">
"So I'm mindful of what goes on around me," Bush added.
</S><S s_id="20">
"On the other hand, I'm also mindful that I've got a life to live and will do so."
</S><S s_id="21">
On Friday, Bush's motorcade drove by the protest site en route to a Republican fund-raising event at a nearby ranch.
</S><S s_id="22">
As Bush rolled by, Sheehan held a sign that said, "Why do you make time for donors and not for me?"
</S><S s_id="23">
Later Friday, more than 100 supporters of Bush led by Mike Gallagher, a radio talk show host, showed up at the protest site to show their support for his Iraq policy.
</S><S s_id="24">
On Saturday, authorities kept the two groups separated.
</S><S s_id="25">
Bush on Saturday also defended his Iraq policy in his weekly radio address, saying the war is going well.
</S><S s_id="26">
"Iraqis are taking control of their country, building a free nation that can govern itself, sustain itself and defense itself," he said.
</S><S s_id="27">
"And we're helping Iraqis succeed."

COMMENTARY: SHEEHAN JUSTIFIED IN BOTHERING BUSH

COMMENTARY: SHEEHAN JUSTIFIED IN BOTHERING BUSH
</S><S s_id="1">
Cindy Sheehan, the grieving and hustling mother who has stalked President Bush to his sagebrush getaway, has acquired public relations advisers, no less.
</S><S s_id="2">
The acquisition seems superfluous.
</S><S s_id="3">
Sheehan herself could hire out as a PR consultant.
</S><S s_id="4">
Experience pays off.
</S><S s_id="5">
Sheehan had been working her way across the country with little to show, beyond the old anti-war fan base, for her effort to stir up righteous opposition to the president's war.
</S><S s_id="6">
Then she hit on the idea of staking out the road to Bush's ranch.
</S><S s_id="7">
Brilliant.
</S><S s_id="8">
Reporters who are doomed to follow presidents to their vacation hidey-holes are a forlorn lot, and the more so when the spot, like Crawford, Texas, is miles from any restaurant worthy of the adjective "expense account."
</S><S s_id="9">
The news is usually sparse to nonexistent and the journalists find themselves turning out for briefings at which some third assistant press secretary cheerily announces that the president is enjoying himself and, far from neglecting business, has congratulated the just-crowned Kansas Corn Queen.
</S><S s_id="10">
So into this bog of sloth and ennui drops Cindy Sheehan.
</S><S s_id="11">
You can count on it that even the most stridently secular journalists were thanking God.
</S><S s_id="12">
Even so, the manna was taken up only slowly.
</S><S s_id="13">
For the first few days, displaying all the vigor that has marked them during the Bush presidency, the media took only gingerly notice.
</S><S s_id="14">
But ultimately the Great American News Machine is right up there with nature in abhorring a vacuum.
</S><S s_id="15">
Feature stories about Sheehan, her son and his service, and about the branch of the family that doesn't cotton to her protest, began appearing.
</S><S s_id="16">
They drew a slow accretion of the like-minded to Sheehan's standard.
</S><S s_id="17">
Sheehan's own small Gold Star Families for Peace was joined by the women's anti-war outfit, CodePink, and by TrueMajority, the political arm of Ben and Jerry's ice cream.
</S><S s_id="18">
And Sheehan got on the horn to the bloggers.
</S><S s_id="19">
With activist free-booters trickling in, before you knew it the media had a genuine pseudo-event on their hands and since have been going to town on the story.
</S><S s_id="20">
As you'd expect, this has the political right indignant, as it is these days at just about everything.
</S><S s_id="21">
Conservatives claim the whole business has been blown out of proportion by the ever-plotting liberal media, who are of course out to get Bush.
</S><S s_id="22">
Public opinion has turned against the war, but the change has carried no great anti-war excitement.
</S><S s_id="23">
The public has maintained considerable poise, given the provocation of a war disingenuously huckstered, ineptly planned and increasingly pricey in life, limb and treasure.
</S><S s_id="24">
Bush's wan gesture of sympathy to Sheehan flopped.
</S><S s_id="25">
He has since hunkered down, and now the motorcades in and out of the ranch have taken to whizzing past the rankling encampment.
</S><S s_id="26">
A blur is apparently the next best thing to out of sight, out of mind.
</S><S s_id="27">
Is Bush discomfited?
</S><S s_id="28">
His supporters complain that he is, but so what?
</S><S s_id="29">
Discomfiture is small enough rebuke, when you consider what he has gotten us into.
</S><S s_id="30">
Cindy Sheehan isn't going to bring anti-war mobs boiling into the streets, but if she gives our oft-proclaimed "war president" a sleepless night or two, it's hard to see how that would be a bad thing.

PROTESTER VOWS TO CONTINUE VIGIL DESPITE VANDALISM AT TEXAS SITE

PROTESTER VOWS TO CONTINUE VIGIL DESPITE VANDALISM AT TEXAS SITE
</S><S s_id="1">
Cindy Sheehan, the mother of a soldier killed in Iraq who has set up a vigil near President Bush's ranch, said Tuesday that she was "very disturbed" that a local resident had mowed down hundreds of small crosses bearing the names of other dead American soldiers.
</S><S s_id="2">
Further, Sheehan promised that her 10-day-old protest was "only the beginning" of what she called a growing national movement to bring all American men and women home from the war.
</S><S s_id="3">
Camp Casey, Sheehan's increasingly crowded roadside encampment named after her son, will soon move to a large property even closer to the president's ranch, she said.
</S><S s_id="4">
"A kind gentleman from down the road offered us the use of his property," Sheehan told reporters Tuesday night.
</S><S s_id="5">
She identified the man as Fred Mattlage, whom she described as a distant cousin of Larry Mattlage, a local resident who fired a shotgun across the road from the encampment on Sunday afternoon.
</S><S s_id="6">
Sheehan said the property, near a Secret Service checkpoint about a mile from Bush's ranch, would have plenty of space for the parked cars that have jammed the roadside, irritating local residents.
</S><S s_id="7">
Fred Mattlage could not be reached on Tuesday to confirm Sheehan's account.
</S><S s_id="8">
In the meantime, a group of Bush's neighbors appeared before the McLennan County Commission on Tuesday morning asking that a no-parking zone near the president's ranch be expanded, effectively forcing Camp Casey to move to the town of Crawford, seven miles away.
</S><S s_id="9">
Neighbors have complained of traffic jams and blocked roads, and some said they worried about the safety of their children, who started school on Tuesday.
</S><S s_id="10">
On Monday night, the police arrested a local resident who had used a truck to mow down about half of the 500 small wooden crosses hammered into the roadside dirt.
</S><S s_id="11">
Sheehan's supporters put the crosses back in place on Tuesday morning.
</S><S s_id="12">
"What happened last night is very disturbing to all of us, and it should be really disturbing to America," Sheehan said in a news conference at Camp Casey on Tuesday morning.
</S><S s_id="13">
"Because no matter what you think about the war, we should all honor the sacrifice of the ones who have fallen.
</S><S s_id="14">
And to me it's so ironic that I'm accused of dishonoring my son's memory by doing what I'm doing, by the other side, and then somebody comes and does this."
</S><S s_id="15">
Sheehan, who has vowed not to leave until Bush comes off his ranch and speaks to her, said that if local residents wanted her to leave, "they should talk to their neighbor, George Bush, and tell him to talk to us."
</S><S s_id="16">
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</S><S s_id="17">
Bush did meet with Sheehan in June 2004, but she has said that the president was disrespectful to her by referring to her as "Mom" throughout the meeting.
</S><S s_id="18">
Bush has since said he is sympathetic to Sheehan, 48, of Vacaville, Calif., whose son, an Army specialist, was killed at 24 in Baghdad on April 4, 2004.
</S><S s_id="19">
On Tuesday a White House spokeswoman, Dana Perino, said that while the president disagreed with Sheehan's views, "he says he respects her right to peacefully protest."
</S><S s_id="20">
Sheehan's supporters said they had planned nearly 1,000 anti-war vigils across the country on Wednesday night.
