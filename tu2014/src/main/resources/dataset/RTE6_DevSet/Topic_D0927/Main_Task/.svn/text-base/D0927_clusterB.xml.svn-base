Peter Jennings, longtime U.S. news anchor, dies at 67 of lung cancer
</S><S s_id="1">
Peter Jennings, the suave, Canadian-born broadcaster who delivered the news to Americans each night in five separate decades, died at age 67.
</S><S s_id="2">
Jennings, who announced in April that he had lung cancer, died Sunday at his New York home, ABC News President David Westin said in a statement.
</S><S s_id="3">
"Peter has been our colleague, our friend, and our leader in so many ways," Westin said.
</S><S s_id="4">
"None of us will be the same without him."
</S><S s_id="5">
With Tom Brokaw and Dan Rather, Jennings was part of a triumvirate that dominated network news for more than two decades, through the birth of cable news and the Internet.
</S><S s_id="6">
His smooth delivery and years of international reporting made him particularly popular among urban dwellers.
</S><S s_id="7">
"Peter was born to be an anchor," Brokaw said Monday on NBC's "Today."
</S><S s_id="8">
He said he met Jennings in 1966 covering Ronald Reagan's campaign for California governor and "we had an instant friendship."
</S><S s_id="9">
Rather, appearing on ABC's "Good Morning America" tribute to Jennings, noted that beneath Jennings' polished exterior was a fierce competitor.
</S><S s_id="10">
"If Peter was in the area code, I didn't sleep," Rather said.
</S><S s_id="11">
Jennings dominated the ratings from the late 1980s to the mid-'90s, when Brokaw surpassed him.
</S><S s_id="12">
He remained a Canadian until 2003, when he became a U.S. citizen, saying it had nothing to do with his politics _ he did it for his family.
</S><S s_id="13">
"He was a warm and loving and surprisingly sentimental man," said fellow ABC anchor Ted Koppel.
</S><S s_id="14">
Jennings deeply regretted dropping out of high school, and he would have wanted that lesson passed along, Koppel said.
</S><S s_id="15">
He made up for it by becoming a student of the world, studying cultures and their people for the rest of his life.
</S><S s_id="16">
"No one could ad lib like Peter," said Barbara Walters.
</S><S s_id="17">
"Sometimes he drove me crazy because he knew every detail. ...
</S><S s_id="18">
He just died much too young."
</S><S s_id="19">
Jennings was wherever the big story was.
</S><S s_id="20">
He logged more than 60 hours on the air during the week of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, offering a soothing sense of continuity during a troubled time.
</S><S s_id="21">
"There are a lot of people who think our job is to reassure the public every night that their home, their community and their nation is safe," he told author Jeff Alan.
</S><S s_id="22">
"I don't subscribe to that at all.
</S><S s_id="23">
I subscribe to leaving people with essentially _ sorry it's a cliche _ a rough draft of history.
</S><S s_id="24">
Some days it's reassuring, some days it's absolutely destructive."
</S><S s_id="25">
Jennings' announcement four months ago that the longtime smoker would begin treatment for lung cancer came as a shock.
</S><S s_id="26">
"I will continue to do the broadcast," he said, his voice husky, in a taped message that night.
</S><S s_id="27">
"On good days, my voice will not always be like this."
</S><S s_id="28">
Although Jennings occasionally came to the office between chemotherapy treatments, he never again appeared on air.
</S><S s_id="29">
Broadcasting was the family business for Jennings.
</S><S s_id="30">
His father, Charles Jennings, was the first person to anchor a nightly national news program in Canada and later became head of the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.'s news division.
</S><S s_id="31">
A picture of his father was displayed prominently in Jennings' office off ABC's newsroom.
</S><S s_id="32">
Charles Jennings' son had a Saturday morning radio show in Ottawa at age 9.
</S><S s_id="33">
Jennings never completed high school or college, and began his career as a reporter at a radio station in Brockville, Ontario.
</S><S s_id="34">
He quickly earned an anchor job at Canadian Television.
</S><S s_id="35">
Sent south to cover the Democratic national convention in 1964, the handsome, dashing correspondent was noticed by ABC's news president.
</S><S s_id="36">
Jennings was offered a reporting job and left Canada for New York.
</S><S s_id="37">
As the third-place news network, ABC figured its only chance was to go after young viewers.
</S><S s_id="38">
Jennings was picked to anchor the evening news and debuted on Feb. 1, 1965.
</S><S s_id="39">
He was 26.
</S><S s_id="40">
"It was a little ridiculous when you think about it," Jennings told author Barbara Matusow.
</S><S s_id="41">
"I was simply unqualified."
</S><S s_id="42">
Critics savaged him as a pretty face, and the experiment ended three years later.
</S><S s_id="43">
He later described the humbling experience as an opportunity, "because I was obliged to figure out who I was and what I really wanted to be."
</S><S s_id="44">
Assigned as a foreign correspondent, Jennings thrived.
</S><S s_id="45">
He established an ABC News bureau in Beirut, Lebanon, and became an expert on the Middle East.
</S><S s_id="46">
He won a Peabody Award for a 1974 profile of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.
</S><S s_id="47">
Jennings returned to the evening news a decade after his unceremonious departure and became the evening news anchor in 1983.
</S><S s_id="48">
Starting in 1986, Jennings began a decade on top of the ratings.
</S><S s_id="49">
He is survived by his wife, Kayce Freed, and his two children, Elizabeth, 25, and Christopher, 23.

A music-filled remembrance for ABC News anchor Peter Jennings at Carnegie Hall
</HEADLINE><DATELINE>

A music-filled remembrance for ABC News anchor Peter Jennings at Carnegie Hall
</S><S s_id="1">
At a music-filled memorial at Carnegie Hall, ABC News anchor Peter Jennings was remembered Tuesday as a journalist with a childlike awe of the world, a devoted father and loyal Canadian who always carried a copy of the U.S. Constitution.
</S><S s_id="2">
A picture of a smiling Jennings, the sun in his face and blue skies behind him, was projected over the stage of the New York landmark.
</S><S s_id="3">
The audience of about 2,000 people was filled with luminaries: Mike Wallace, Brian Williams, Dan Rather, Tom Wolfe, Larry King, Jon Stewart, Charles Gibson, Al Sharpton, Alan Alda, George Stephanopoulos, Bob Schieffer, Michael Eisner, Elizabeth Vargas and her husband Marc Cohn.
</S><S s_id="4">
"An anchor is what keeps a ship from drifting into dangerous waters," said ABC News President David Westin.
</S><S s_id="5">
"It keeps us steady and secure during the night, and that's what Peter was to ABC News."
</S><S s_id="6">
When they joined the network four decades ago, Ted Koppel recalled how he was known as the smart one and Jennings the handsome one.
</S><S s_id="7">
Jennings _ who died of lung cancer Aug. 7 _ kept his looks to the end but was also "very, very smart," he said.
</S><S s_id="8">
"From the time I first met Peter 41 years ago until our last meeting a few weeks ago, I felt a thrill whenever I saw him," the "Nightline" host said.
</S><S s_id="9">
"Not that many people have that charisma, that kind of animal magnetism that makes it difficult to focus on anybody else in the room."
</S><S s_id="10">
Jennings, ABC's chief news anchor for more than 20 years, was also "famously attracted to women," Koppel said.
</S><S s_id="11">
"Even so, he only married four of them."
</S><S s_id="12">
A handful of homeless people were also in the hall.
</S><S s_id="13">
Jennings' widow, Kayce, was startled recently when a homeless man approached to express sympathy for her loss; Jennings had befriended him during walks in Central Park.
</S><S s_id="14">
Jennings frequently served meals to the homeless after leaving the ABC News studio and its evening broadcast of "World News Tonight," said Mary Brosnahan Sullivan of the Coalition for the Homeless.
</S><S s_id="15">
"The Peter I knew was somebody of concrete action," she said.
</S><S s_id="16">
Personal remembrances were interspersed with music _ a gospel choir, violinist Natalie MacMaster, cellist Yo-Yo Ma, singer Alison Krauss and a jazz combo featuring Wynton Marsalis.
</S><S s_id="17">
Jennings was an insatiable jazz fan.
</S><S s_id="18">
"For Peter, jazz was more than just a form of music, it was a way of looking at life," Westin said.
</S><S s_id="19">
A hopeless sentimentalist, Jennings was "the only person I knew who got weepy telling about his service on jury duty," ABC producer Tom Nagorski said.
</S><S s_id="20">
Alan Alda recalled Jennings as "complex and simple at the same time, knowledgeable and inquisitive, kind and tough at the same time, gracious and direct."
</S><S s_id="21">
He never left a social engagement without Jennings giving him a book; the last was a copy of the Constitution, he said.
</S><S s_id="22">
Jennings never lost his Canadian identity _ an honor guard from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police marched at the service _ but was proud also to become a U.S. citizen a few years before he died.
</S><S s_id="23">
Since his death many of his ABC News colleagues have worn bracelets saying "what would Peter do?"
</S><S s_id="24">
For all the professional colleagues and anecdotes at the memorial, the pictures projected onstage showed an off-camera Jennings on family outings.
</S><S s_id="25">
Friends said his two children, Chris and Elizabeth, were his proudest accomplishments.
</S><S s_id="26">
They were also the last to speak at the nearly two-hour remembrance.
</S><S s_id="27">
"There is no way to express how much I miss my father," his son said.
</S><S s_id="28">
"Each day is, above all else, a day without him."

ABC Anchorman Peter Jennings Dies
</HEADLINE><TEXT><S s_id="0">
ABC Anchorman Peter Jennings Dies
</S><S s_id="1">
Peter Jennings, the urbane anchorman of ABC's evening newscast for the past 22 years, died Sunday, it was announced by his network.
</S><S s_id="2">
He was 67.
</S><S s_id="3">
It was reported that he had died at his home in New York.
</S><S s_id="4">
Jennings had not been on the air since April 5 when he revealed he had lung cancer.
</S><S s_id="5">
He had been conspicuously absent from the coverage of Pope John Paul II's funeral in Rome.
</S><S s_id="6">
A smoker until about 20 years ago, he said he relapsed under the pressure of Sept. 11, 2001 but later quit again.
</S><S s_id="7">
The Canadian-born Jennings was a familiar face in millions of households for more than 40 years.
</S><S s_id="8">
His well-rounded tones, world-savvy air and matter-of-fact delivery led "World News Tonight" to the top of the ratings for 11 of the past 20 years, even as all the networks lost huge numbers of viewers to cable television, to the Internet and to the longer workdays and busier lives of those who used to watch the news over the family dinner.
</S><S s_id="9">
Jennings ranged the world as a reporter and anchorman, specializing in the Middle East long before many domestic viewers knew much more about the region than the location of Jerusalem and the movie "Lawrence of Arabia."
</S><S s_id="10">
He was at the Summer Olympic Games in Munich Sept. 5, 1972 when Arab terrorists seized and killed Israeli athletes.
</S><S s_id="11">
Familiar with the history and goals of the Black September terrorist group, Jennings filed a series of reports, and moved his camera crew close enough to get clear pictures of the terrorists, which "displayed considerable moxie," wrote Barbara Matusow in "The Evening Stars: The Making of the Network News Anchor."
</S><S s_id="12">
She called it "among the most gripping episodes ever shown on live television."
</S><S s_id="13">
Twenty-nine years later, Jennings was on the air within minutes after two airliners crashed into the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001, and stayed on the air for more than 12 consecutive hours, and for 60 hours that first week, ABC News said in its biography of the anchor.
</S><S s_id="14">
His steadiness and "Herculean" work during that period was widely praised.
</S><S s_id="15">
"We watched Peter Jennings' beard grow, and we were somehow reassured that he did not shave, that through morning, afternoon, evening and on into the night, he did not leave the desk, that he confided in us his uncertainties, that he shared the confusions of each hour," Washington Post columnist Marc Fisher wrote.
</S><S s_id="16">
"He grew more pale and more vulnerable, as if he knew that we needed him to be human, so that we could be together."
</S><S s_id="17">
During that devastating day, as all activity stopped and Americans remained glued to their televisions, Jennings' trademark cool warmed as he faltered just a bit.
</S><S s_id="18">
"We do not very often make recommendations for people's behavior from this chair," he told viewers, "but as (one ABC News correspondent) was talking, I checked in with my children, and it -- who were deeply stressed, as I think young people are across the United States.
</S><S s_id="19">
So, if you're a parent, you've got a kid" -- he paused and smiled awkwardly -- "in some other part of the country, call them up.
</S><S s_id="20">
Exchange observations."
</S><S s_id="21">
He became a citizen of the United States in 2003, 39 years after he left Canada.
</S><S s_id="22">
"There's no explaining the timing," he told USA Today.
</S><S s_id="23">
"Did 9/11 make a difference?
</S><S s_id="24">
Yes, it did make a difference.
</S><S s_id="25">
Did working on (his book) 'In Search of America' for the last several years, which kept me on the road a lot and dealing with both contemporary and historic national issues -- about which I felt very deeply?
</S><S s_id="26">
That made a difference."
</S><S s_id="27">
His death marked a year in which the evening anchors of all three major broadcast networks left the anchor's chair.
</S><S s_id="28">
NBC's Tom Brokaw retired in December 2004, and CBS' Dan Rather stepped down from the anchor's job in March 2005.
</S><S s_id="29">
Born in Toronto, the son of pioneering Canadian broadcaster Charles Jennings, an 11-year-old Peter Jennings first broadcast "Peter's People," a radio show for children.
</S><S s_id="30">
He dropped out of high school, worked briefly in a bank and then entered broadcasting.
</S><S s_id="31">
He became a radio news reporter in Brockton, Ontario and worked briefly for the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. before switching to co-anchor CTV National News at Canada's first privately owned network in 1962.
</S><S s_id="32">
While covering the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, Jennings attracted the attention of the then-president of ABC, Elmer W. Lower, who offered him a job.
</S><S s_id="33">
Jennings turned it down but three months later reconsidered.
</S><S s_id="34">
Based in New York City, he was immediately seen as a rising star.
</S><S s_id="35">
A year later, at age 26, he was named co-anchor and then sole anchor of ABC Evening News' 15-minute broadcast.
</S><S s_id="36">
His inexperience showed, especially in comparison to veteran competitors Walter Cronkite at CBS and Chet Huntley and David Brinkley on NBC.
</S><S s_id="37">
Widely derided as a "glamorcaster" and "anchorboy," Jennings was ridiculed for his Anglicized diction and ignorance of American history and culture.
</S><S s_id="38">
After three years, he returned to the ranks of domestic news correspondents.
</S><S s_id="39">
He was sent to the Middle East in 1969 to establish the first American television news bureau in the Arab world, and there he found his niche.
</S><S s_id="40">
For seven years, based in Beirut, he traveled to virtually every Arab country and built a store of knowledge he would draw upon for years.
</S><S s_id="41">
His reporting during the 1973 Israeli-Arab war earned the respect of viewers.
</S><S s_id="42">
He conducted the first television interview with Palestine Liberation Organization's Yasser Arafat, and his 1974 profile of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat won his first George Foster Peabody award.
</S><S s_id="43">
He was the first U.S. reporter to interview the Iranian Ayatollah Khomeini, then in exile in Paris.
</S><S s_id="44">
Jennings returned to the U.S. in 1975 as Washington correspondent and news reader for the predecessor to Good Morning America.
</S><S s_id="45">
After 10 months, he was reassigned overseas as chief foreign correspondent, based in London.
</S><S s_id="46">
ABC executive Roone Arledge then created a three-anchor broadcast, with Frank Reynolds in Washington, Max Robinson in Chicago and Jennings in London.
</S><S s_id="47">
In 1983, after Reynolds died of cancer, Jennings was called back to the U.S. to retrieve his role as ABC's sole anchorman.
</S><S s_id="48">
His years at the helm were not without glitches.
</S><S s_id="49">
He, along with the other major networks, prematurely and erroneously reported that Democratic nominee Al Gore won Florida in the 2000 presidential election.
</S><S s_id="50">
Jennings was frequently accused of liberal bias by conservative media watchdog organizations, and pro-Palestinian bias by Israeli partisans.
</S><S s_id="51">
A 2004 commentary in a journalism trade magazine, the Columbia Journalism Review, dismissed criticism that ABC's newscast was "anti-war," noting that "despite the pressure to be a cheerleader, World News Tonight with Peter Jennings was more probing during the war than its rivals.
</S><S s_id="52">
The center's anti-war label is looking like ABC's red badge of courage."
</S><S s_id="53">
Washington Post television critic Tom Shales, who is no fan of Jennings, in 1994 praised his special on the Bosnian war, writing, "You have to hand it to Peter Jennings.
</S><S s_id="54">
He has managed to maintain his dignity and his stature even as network news has grown increasingly tabloidian all around him.
</S><S s_id="55">
He has stayed above the fray, and as frays go, this one is particularly unsavory...
</S><S s_id="56">
It isn't lurid or sexy and it probably won't get big ratings, but it's the kind of thing a network news division ought to be doing just for the sake of doing it....
</S><S s_id="57">
It could easily be argued that CBS News remembers (Edward R.)
</S><S s_id="58">
Murrow in words, whereas ABC News remembers him in deeds -- deeds like tonight's Jennings report."
</S><S s_id="59">
Five times he was named the country's best anchorman in a poll of readers of another trade magazine, Washington Journalism Review.
</S><S s_id="60">
He won Harvard University's Goldsmith Career Award for excellence in journalism and the Radio and Television News Directors Paul White Award, chosen by the news directors of all three major networks.
</S><S s_id="61">
"World News Tonight" was honored with the Edward R. Murrow award for best national newscast in 2004.
</S><S s_id="62">
He won 14 national Emmys, two George Foster Peabody awards, several Overseas Press Club awards and several Alfred I duPont Columbia University Awards for journalism.
</S><S s_id="63">
In addition to anchoring, he covered issues in depth on hour-long primetime specials, called "Peter Jennings Reporting."
</S><S s_id="64">
Begun in 1990, the show ranged from historic issues such as the Kennedy assassination to religious controversies to the crisis in arts funding to a chronicle of the bombers of Oklahoma City, as well as international crises.
</S><S s_id="65">
He anchored live news specials for children, and co-wrote "The Century" (1998) with Todd Brewster, which later became a 12-hour ABC series.
</S><S s_id="66">
He and Brewster also collaborated on "In Search of America" (2002).
</S><S s_id="67">
His marriages to Valerie Godsoe, Annie Malouf and Kati Marton ended in divorce.
</S><S s_id="68">
Survivors include his wife, Kayce Freed of New York City; and two children from his third marriage, Elizabeth and Christopher.

Longtime ABC Anchor Peter Jennings, 67, Dies

Longtime ABC Anchor Peter Jennings, 67, Dies
</S><S s_id="1">
Peter Jennings, a Canadian-born high school dropout who became the face of ABC News and a household name in the United States, died of lung cancer Sunday at his home in New York.
</S><S s_id="2">
He was 67.
</S><S s_id="3">
ABC News announced his death Sunday night and released a statement from his wife Kayce Freed, his 25-year-old daughter Elizabeth Jennings and his 23-year-old son Christopher Jennings.
</S><S s_id="4">
"Peter died with his family around him, without pain and in peace," it read.
</S><S s_id="5">
"He knew he'd lived a good life."
</S><S s_id="6">
His death was met with grief at ABC, where he functioned as both the public face and behind-the-scenes manager of "World News Tonight."
</S><S s_id="7">
ABC News President David Westin called the 41-year ABC veteran -- known for his urbane demeanor and driven perfectionism -- "our colleague, our friend, and our leader," adding: "None of us will be the same without him."
</S><S s_id="8">
Westin said Jennings had faced his fight against lung cancer "with realism, courage, and a firm hope that he would be one of the fortunate ones."
</S><S s_id="9">
"In the end, he was not," he said.
</S><S s_id="10">
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in U.S. men and women, accounting for 163,510 deaths this year.
</S><S s_id="11">
Most cases of lung cancer are directly attributable to smoking.
</S><S s_id="12">
A lung cancer diagnosis presents a poor prognosis, with a one-year survival rate of only 42 percent and a five-year rate of 15 percent.
</S><S s_id="13">
Jennings' death comes as a bitter bookend to a decades-long era in television news dominated by three well-known figures: the longtime ABC newsman, CBS' Dan Rather and NBC's Tom Brokaw.
</S><S s_id="14">
Brokaw retired in December, and Rather stepped down from the evening news in March.
</S><S s_id="15">
A longtime smoker, Jennings first announced his diagnosis April 5, when he said he would begin chemotherapy treatment.
</S><S s_id="16">
In a poignant taped message that aired on "World News Tonight," Jennings -- his voice already hoarse and raw -- said he had quit smoking 20 year ago but was "weak" and took it up again after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
</S><S s_id="17">
He pledged to continue to anchor "World News Tonight" on "good days."
</S><S s_id="18">
That was his last time on the air.
</S><S s_id="19">
In his absence, "Good Morning America" co-host Charles Gibson and "20/20" co-anchor Elizabeth Vargas, among others, have filled in for him.
</S><S s_id="20">
During his four decades at ABC -- especially his last 22 as anchor -- Jennings developed a reputation for rigorous standards and a devotion to substantive stories, especially international affairs.
</S><S s_id="21">
As managing editor of "World News Tonight," he combed over every script that went on the broadcast.
</S><S s_id="22">
"Peter was a real guardian at the gate," said Judy Muller, a contributing ABC correspondent and an assistant professor at the University of Southern California.
</S><S s_id="23">
"He was so committed to the integrity of news."
</S><S s_id="24">
Peter Charles Archibald Ewart Jennings was born on July 29, 1938, in Toronto.
</S><S s_id="25">
He spent most of his childhood in Ottawa.
</S><S s_id="26">
He gained his passion for broadcast news from his father, Charles Jennings, who was the first person to anchor a nightly national news program in Canada and became head of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's news division.
</S><S s_id="27">
Jennings once referred him as his "only hero."
</S><S s_id="28">
At age 9, Jennings was already hosting a weekly children's show called "Peter's People" on CBC radio, reading letters from children on the air.
</S><S s_id="29">
But he was unenthusiastic about school and dropped out of high school in the 10th grade.
</S><S s_id="30">
He quickly made his way in broadcasting, working for a small radio station in Brockville, Ontario, and then landing a job as the host of a CBC public affairs show in Montreal.
</S><S s_id="31">
At age 24, he was already co-anchoring Canada's first private network newscast and was spotted by an ABC correspondent covering a NATO meeting.
</S><S s_id="32">
ABC recruited the young anchor in 1964.
</S><S s_id="33">
Impressed with his good looks and poise, the network thrust him briefly into the anchor chair, but the 26-year-old proved to be too green for the post.
</S><S s_id="34">
In 1967, he began his career as a foreign correspondent, opening the network's bureau in Beirut, Lebanon.
</S><S s_id="35">
He rapidly made his mark in covering hot spots around the world.
</S><S s_id="36">
He was in Munich, Germany, in 1972 when Arab terrorists took Israeli athletes hostage at the Olympics.
</S><S s_id="37">
He covered the battle over apartheid in South Africa and was in Berlin to report on the Berlin Wall coming down.
</S><S s_id="38">
Jennings became ABC's chief foreign correspondent and was based in London when the network asked him to return to the anchor desk as part of a three-person team, with Frank Reynolds based in Washington and Max Robinson in Chicago.
</S><S s_id="39">
When Reynolds died of cancer in 1983, Jennings took over as the only anchor.
</S><S s_id="40">
He helped power ABC to the top of the ratings for a decade, winning over viewers with his witty, sophisticated manner.
</S><S s_id="41">
He continued to travel extensively to cover stories, and was most recently in Iraq in January to report on the elections there.
</S><S s_id="42">
"He was a person with an enormous amount of experience and self-confidence -- and a presence," said Richard Wald, a former ABC News executive.
</S><S s_id="43">
"That's all you can say about him.
</S><S s_id="44">
He had it, he always did."
</S><S s_id="45">
Aside from his wife and children, he is survived by his sister Sarah Jennings.
</S><S s_id="46">
There was no immediate word on services.

Jennings' Death Leaves Sorrow, Big Shoes to Fill at ABC
</S><S s_id="1">
Anchor Peter Jennings' death was met Monday with a cascade of sorrowful appreciations from national leaders, colleagues and viewers around the country as anguished ABC employees struggled to absorb the impact of his loss on the network.
</S><S s_id="2">
Jennings -- who died at home in New York on Sunday night four months after he was diagnosed with lung cancer -- was hailed as a fiercely determined newsman who infused his broadcasts with a sophisticated sensibility honed by years as a foreign correspondent.
</S><S s_id="3">
Often demanding, he occasionally frustrated co-workers with his relentless probing, an approach many credit with raising the standards of ABC News.
</S><S s_id="4">
He was lauded by everyone from President Bush -- who called him "a part of the life of a lot of our fellow citizens" -- to more than 25,000 viewers who posted messages on the ABC News Web site expressing their grief at his death.
</S><S s_id="5">
"One word describes Peter Jennings on air: Class," wrote one.
</S><S s_id="6">
"He shall be missed."
</S><S s_id="7">
With his death, retired NBC anchor Tom Brokaw said that he felt "as if I've lost a member of my family," while former CBS anchor Dan Rather praised Jennings as "one of the most talented, caring and successful electronic journalists of all time."
</S><S s_id="8">
The debonair Jennings anchored "World News Tonight" for the last 22 years, half of his four decades-long career at ABC.
</S><S s_id="9">
As managing editor of the evening broadcast, he oversaw each story that went on the air, personally editing nearly every story script.
</S><S s_id="10">
"In many respects, Peter is the news division," said Paul Slavin, senior vice president of worldwide newsgathering for ABC News.
</S><S s_id="11">
"There was never a decision that was made without considering what Peter thought about it. ...
</S><S s_id="12">
He was, in a way, the persistent conscience."
</S><S s_id="13">
Jennings' death forces ABC to confront a similar challenge that NBC and CBS have faced in the last year: settling on a successor for an established anchor.
</S><S s_id="14">
Brokaw's handoff of the "NBC Nightly News" to Brian Williams in December was long-planned and widely praised as a seamless transition.
</S><S s_id="15">
CBS has tapped veteran Washington correspondent Bob Schieffer to temporarily replace Rather, who left the anchor desk in March, while the network mulls over a new format for its broadcast.
</S><S s_id="16">
ABC executives said Monday that no decisions have yet been made about who will take over for Jennings.
</S><S s_id="17">
For now, "Good Morning America" co-host Charles Gibson and "20/20" co-anchor Elizabeth Vargas will continue to anchor "World News Tonight" on a temporary basis.
</S><S s_id="18">
Network officials had hoped that the changes at the other networks this year would give Jennings a chance to regain the title of the top-rated evening newscast, a position he held from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s.
</S><S s_id="19">
But after the anchor, a longtime smoker, learned he was fighting lung cancer in April, he immediately began chemotherapy.
</S><S s_id="20">
"He has left us with a phenomenal foundation, and it is a foundation that we will move forward with," Slavin said.
</S><S s_id="21">
"The corporeal part of Peter may not be here, but his thoughts and his ideas, his demands for excellence and his heart will stay here."
</S><S s_id="22">
As an exacting editor, Jennings pushed himself and those around him relentlessly, often asking correspondents to repeatedly rewrite their story scripts.
</S><S s_id="23">
"He drove everyone very hard, including and perhaps especially, himself," said congressional correspondent Linda Douglass.
</S><S s_id="24">
"He involved himself in every detail of our news coverage, from deciding which stories were covered to how they were covered to how the stories were written.
</S><S s_id="25">
At ABC News, it felt as though he was in our bloodstream."
</S><S s_id="26">
Paul Friedman, a longtime executive producer of "World News Tonight," said Jennings had an "insatiable curiosity."
</S><S s_id="27">
"He was a perfectionist, which made him terrific to work with in the sense that it was challenging all the time, and occasionally difficult," Friedman said.
</S><S s_id="28">

</S><S s_id="29">
Jennings' drive was rooted partly in his embarrassment that he never completed high school or college, according to friends and former colleagues.
</S><S s_id="30">
Wherever he traveled for stories -- which was often -- the anchor brought with him a suitcase full of books to read.
</S><S s_id="31">
"He felt he had to prove himself," said CNN Washington bureau chief David Bohrman, who worked with Jennings for more than a decade as a senior producer at ABC.
</S><S s_id="32">
"You always got the impression that he felt he was going to be exposed as a fraud any minute because he didn't finish school.
</S><S s_id="33">
He just couldn't rest.
</S><S s_id="34">
He never realized how good he was."
</S><S s_id="35">
(End optional trim)
</S><S s_id="36">
Colleagues said Jennings also brought a sentimental, compassionate approach to stories that he rarely let viewers see.
</S><S s_id="37">
Slavin said the anchor would push producers to home in on the emotional core of the news, such as a mother's loss of her son in Iraq.
</S><S s_id="38">
"He is one of the most sensitive, emotional anchors in the business," said Slavin, repeatedly referring to Jennings in the present tense.
</S><S s_id="39">
Up until his final days, Jennings believed he could win his battle with lung cancer, friends said.
</S><S s_id="40">
"Frankly, I thought he would as well, because I knew what a brave, fierce competitor he was," Rather said.
</S><S s_id="41">
"But the odds were too long."

Jennings Brought Reportorial Experience to Anchor Post

Jennings Brought Reportorial Experience to Anchor Post
</S><S s_id="1">
Peter Jennings' untimely death Sunday put a period to the era in which network anchors derived their "authority" from journalistic experience, as well as on-camera presence.
</S><S s_id="2">
If television viewers are unlikely to see his equal again, it has less to do with Jennings' unique personal qualities -- formidable as they were -- than with the melancholy state of the three broadcast networks' news operations.
</S><S s_id="3">
Years of shortsighted and unremitting cost-cutting by their corporate proprietors have made them shells of what they once were.
</S><S s_id="4">
Among the network and cable news divisions, only CNN maintains anything like a full-service foreign reporting operation; increasingly, even the others' commitment to comprehensive domestic coverage is withering.
</S><S s_id="5">
So if ABC wanted to cultivate another Jennings -- someone with a sophisticated reportorial background and an engaging broadcast persona -- it simply lacks the organizational ability to do it.
</S><S s_id="6">
In 1965, for example, when the then-26-year-old Jennings had a disastrous first go at anchoring ABC's nightly newscast, he described himself as "simply unqualified."
</S><S s_id="7">
To remedy that, he spent more than a decade reporting from ABC bureaus in the Middle East and Europe.
</S><S s_id="8">
By the time he was named as one of three co-anchors of the network's "World News Tonight" in 1978, he was ABC's chief foreign correspondent.
</S><S s_id="9">
Can anybody name the person who occupies that assignment today?
</S><S s_id="10">
Perhaps more important, can anyone imagine one of the current crop of television news "personalities" admitting he or she is unqualified to do anything from brain surgery to stand-up comedy?
</S><S s_id="11">
Although wealth and celebrity came with his anchorman's chair, Jennings never lost his field reporter's legs.
</S><S s_id="12">
It seems a commonplace observation to make, but constantly gathering facts and, then, thinking about them in some systematic way is what prepares journalists to respond intelligently to the demands of breaking news.
</S><S s_id="13">
Most recently, many Americans saw Jennings do just that in the more than 60 hours of sober and reflective broadcasting he did in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 atrocities.
</S><S s_id="14">
Monday, his former colleague Barbara Walters was among those who singled out Jennings' nearly unmatched ability to ad lib smartly and often eloquently while covering developing stories.
</S><S s_id="15">
Canadian news anchor Lloyd Robertson said that "Peter brought a high quality of literature to electronic journalism.
</S><S s_id="16">
There was nobody who could put things together on the air as easily and as rapidly as he did."
</S><S s_id="17">
(Begin optional trim)
</S><S s_id="18">
Part of that was mental agility, part unremitting attention to his work.
</S><S s_id="19">
During the mid-1990s, my wife, Leslie Abramson, was a legal analyst for ABC News.
</S><S s_id="20">
While on business in New York, she ran into Jennings, who invited her to join a group of network executives and broadcasters that night at the Committee to Protect Journalists' annual dinner.
</S><S s_id="21">
During the course of the essentially ceremonial evening with its introductions and speeches, Leslie noticed Jennings repeatedly reaching into an inside coat pocket for a small, bound notebook in which he made notations.
</S><S s_id="22">
"Are you taking notes on this?" she asked.
</S><S s_id="23">
"No," Jennings replied.
</S><S s_id="24">
"I write down thoughts as they occur to me.
</S><S s_id="25">
You never know when you're going to need a good idea."
</S><S s_id="26">
(End optional trim)
</S><S s_id="27">
Relentless and inquisitive preparation was one thing that distinguished Jennings' journalism, but so did a perspective that actually was quite singular.
</S><S s_id="28">
The cool, engaged-but-somewhat-apart persona that Jennings brought to his on-screen work was as much as matter of intellect as temperament.
</S><S s_id="29">
Jennings the journalist was quintessentially a man of the middle distance.
</S><S s_id="30">
Some of that may have been attributable to his Canadian origins.
</S><S s_id="31">
U.S. attitudes toward the rest of the world tend to oscillate between hysterical triumphalism and lacerating self-loathing.
</S><S s_id="32">
Around both poles, what tends to be lost is the fact that there are other people in the world, who live their own lives and act for reasons of their own.
</S><S s_id="33">
As a physically vast nation with a tiny population, most of which lives hard up against the United States, Canadians tend to approach other people and countries with a wry combination of self-deprecation and self-assertion.
</S><S s_id="34">
Those qualities were one of the things that made Jennings a superb foreign correspondent.
</S><S s_id="35">
Shortly after 9/11, Jennings became a naturalized American, though he retained his Canadian citizenship.
</S><S s_id="36">
In an interview with the Canadian Press at the time, he explained his decision: "I am a Canadian.
</S><S s_id="37">
My mother, like many of her generation, always found a reason to resent the United States and defined herself as a Canadian by being not American."
</S><S s_id="38">
In the wake of the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, however, Jennings experienced his connection to other Americans in an urgent new way.
</S><S s_id="39">
"I felt more attached to them than I perhaps had anticipated in emotional terms," he said.
</S><S s_id="40">
"This is my home."
</S><S s_id="41">
As television news increasingly trades on attitude and entertainment rather than reporting and analysis, one of the things that will be missed most about Jennings and his work is the respect he showed for American viewers.
</S><S s_id="42">
Without intending to, he once summed that quality up in an interview with the Toronto Star:
</S><S s_id="43">
"There are a lot of people in this business who believe that part of our job is to reassure the public every night," Jennings said.
</S><S s_id="44">
"I subscribe to leaving people with essentially a rough draft of history.
</S><S s_id="45">
Some days it is reassuring.
</S><S s_id="46">
Some days, it is absolutely destructive."
</S><S s_id="47">
One of the tragedies of our time is that the corporate time-servers who now direct the course of broadcast journalism do not share Peter Jennings' faith that American viewers are entitled to that respect.

Jennings' Private Life Is Remembered at Memorial

Jennings' Private Life Is Remembered at Memorial
</S><S s_id="1">
Peter Jennings' four-decade career as a network television reporter and anchor made him a national media star, but those who knew the ABC newsman best remembered him Tuesday in deeply personal terms, recalling the "goofy" father who loved to dance the jitterbug while cooking and the man of quiet generosity who took a personal interest in the homeless living in Central Park.
</S><S s_id="2">
A two-hour memorial service, held at Carnegie Hall a little more than a month after the 67-year-old anchor died of lung cancer, focused less on his work as a broadcast journalist and more on recollections of his private life by family, friends and colleagues.
</S><S s_id="3">
"He was often described as cosmopolitan, but I think my father valued awe over sophistication," said Christopher Jennings, his 23-year-old son, noting his love of canoe trips and his fierce devotion to his family.
</S><S s_id="4">
"The slightest achievement by his children -- or even his dog -- could wet his eyes," he said.
</S><S s_id="5">
"My father gave love in earnest."
</S><S s_id="6">
"Each day is, above all else, a day without him," his son added.
</S><S s_id="7">
About 2,000 people filled the gilded auditorium for the emotional celebration of Jennings' life, including nearly all of the top television network executives and journalists: NBC anchor Brian Williams, "Today" co-hosts Katie Couric and Matt Lauer, former CBS anchor Dan Rather, current CBS anchor Bob Schieffer, "Good Morning America" co-hosts Charles Gibson and Diane Sawyer, Fox News host Bill O'Reilly, CNN anchor Aaron Brown and PBS interviewer Charlie Rose.
</S><S s_id="8">
(Former NBC anchor Tom Brokaw was caring for his mother in California and could not attend.)
</S><S s_id="9">
New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg attended, , as did his predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and the Rev. Al Sharpton.
</S><S s_id="10">
Performers included cellist Yo-Yo Ma and jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis.
</S><S s_id="11">
"From the time I first met Peter 41 years ago until our last meeting a few weeks ago, I felt a thrill whenever I saw him," said Ted Koppel, host of ABC's "Nightline."
</S><S s_id="12">
"Not many people have genuine charisma, that kind of animal magnetism that makes it difficult to focus on anyone else in the room.
</S><S s_id="13">
Peter had that."
</S><S s_id="14">
Jennings' death on Aug. 7, just four months after he had announced his diagnosis, has been a major blow to ABC.
</S><S s_id="15">
The network has not settled on who will replace him as anchor of "World News Tonight."
</S><S s_id="16">
Robert Iger, chief executive of the Walt Disney Co., ABC's parent corporation, said the company owed Jennings "an extraordinary debt of gratitude" for his work, adding how difficult it was to accept his death.
</S><S s_id="17">
"When you know someone of Peter's dynamism and presence, you simply think they will always be there," Iger said at the memorial.
</S><S s_id="18">
But for the most part, speakers took note of their private loss.
</S><S s_id="19">
A montage of photos projected on the back of the stage throughout the service depicted Jennings' off-air life: bicycling and hanging off the side of a sailboat, embracing his children and walking arm in arm with his wife, Kayce Freed.
</S><S s_id="20">
In the images, Jennings looked tan and healthy, squinting into the sun with a contented smile.
</S><S s_id="21">
Actor Alan Alda said Jennings was simply "authentic."
</S><S s_id="22">
He recalled how the anchor would insist on staying to help wash dishes after dinner parties and how he always gave him a book to read after visits, most recently a copy of the U.S. Constitution.
</S><S s_id="23">
"There's a vacancy now that no president can fill, no power on Earth can fill," Alda said.
</S><S s_id="24">
"Others will step in and fill in his shoes excellently.
</S><S s_id="25">
But no one can replace the unique presence that was Peter."
</S><S s_id="26">
Mary Brosnahan Sullivan, executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless, said a number of homeless people who live in the park across from Jennings' Manhattan apartment approached his widow, Kayce, after he died, offering their condolences and noting how he frequently took the time to speak with them.
</S><S s_id="27">
Jennings often volunteered to distribute meals to the homeless around the city, she said, and would engage in long conversations with the people he met.
</S><S s_id="28">
"Maybe today," she said, "we can try to see the world the way Peter saw it."
</S><S s_id="29">
Jennings' 25-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, spoke last, telling the tearful audience: "Without him, I find myself stumbling and in the dark. ...
</S><S s_id="30">
Loving him so much and not having him with me is the hardest thing I've ever done."

PETER JENNINGS, ABC NEWS ANCHOR, DIES AT 67
</HEADLINE><DATELINE>
NEW YORK
</DATELINE><TEXT><S s_id="0">
PETER JENNINGS, ABC NEWS ANCHOR, DIES AT 67
</S><S s_id="1">
Peter Jennings, a high school dropout from Canada who transformed himself into one of the most urbane, well-traveled and recognizable journalists on American television, died Sunday.
</S><S s_id="2">
He was 67 and lived in Manhattan.
</S><S s_id="3">
The cause of death was lung cancer, said Charles Gibson, who announced the death of his colleague on television in a special report just after 11:30 p.m.
</S><S s_id="4">
Jennings had disclosed that he was suffering from lung cancer on April 5, first in a written statement released by ABC and later that night on "World News Tonight," the evening news broadcast that he had led since September 1983.
</S><S s_id="5">
In brief remarks at the end of that night's program, Jennings, his voice scratchy, told viewers that he hoped to return to the anchor desk as his health and strength permitted.
</S><S s_id="6">
But he never did.
</S><S s_id="7">
It was a jarring departure for someone who for so long had been such a visible fixture in so many American homes each night.
</S><S s_id="8">
Along with the two other pillars of the so-called "Big 3" -- Tom Brokaw of NBC and Dan Rather of CBS -- Jennings had, in the early 1980s, ushered in the era of the television news anchor as lavishly compensated, globe-trotting superstar.
</S><S s_id="9">
After the departure of Brokaw from his anchor chair in December, followed by Rather's retirement from the evening news in March, Jennings' death brings that era to a close.
</S><S s_id="10">
For more than two decades, the magnitude of a news event could be measured, at least in part, by whether Jennings and his counterparts on the other two networks showed up on the scene.
</S><S s_id="11">
Indeed, they logged so many miles over so many years in so many trench coats and flak jackets that they effectively acted as bookends on some of the biggest running stories of modern times.
</S><S s_id="12">
Jennings' official ABC biography notes, for example, that as a foreign correspondent, he was "in Berlin in the 1960s when the Berlin Wall was going up," and there again, as an anchor, "in the 1990s when it came down."
</S><S s_id="13">
Similarly, he was on the ground in Gdansk, Poland, for the birth of the Solidarity labor and political movement, and later for the overthrow of the country's communist government.
</S><S s_id="14">
In addition to every major world capital and war zone, Jennings also reported from all 50 states, according to the network.
</S><S s_id="15">
He seemed to draw on that collective experience -- as well as his practiced ability to calmly describe events as they unfolded live -- not long after two hijacked planes struck the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001.
</S><S s_id="16">
Over the course of that day, and those that immediately followed, he would spend more than 60 hours on the air in what Tom Shales of The Washington Post, among other critics, praised as a tour de force of interviewing and explanatory broadcast journalism laced with undisguised bewilderment.
</S><S s_id="17">
"This is what it looked like moments ago," Jennings said at one point that first morning, as he introduced a piece of videotape recorded moments earlier in Lower Manhattan.
</S><S s_id="18">
"My God!
</S><S s_id="19">
The southern tower, 10:00 Eastern time this morning, just collapsing on itself.
</S><S s_id="20">
This is a place where thousands of people worked.
</S><S s_id="21">
We have no idea what caused this."
</S><S s_id="22">
The coverage of all three broadcast networks that week underscored a maxim of the television news business: that however much the audience of the evening news programs may have eroded in recent years, viewers usually return during moments of crisis.
</S><S s_id="23">
At the peak of his broadcast's popularity, in the 1992-93 television season, Jennings drew an average audience of nearly 14 million people each night, according to Nielsen Media Research.
</S><S s_id="24">
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</S><S s_id="25">
He reached that milestone midway through an eight-year ratings winning streak, during which his audience sometimes exceeded those of both Brokaw and Rather by 2 million or more viewers.
</S><S s_id="26">
(For nearly a decade since, to his periodic frustration, his broadcast had lagged behind that of NBC's, even after Brokaw yielded to Brian Williams in December.)
</S><S s_id="27">
Though the audience for the evening news has fallen precipitously in recent years -- a casualty of changes in people's schedules and the competition offered by the cable news networks and the Internet -- Jennings' broadcast (and those on CBS and NBC) still drew a combined audience of more than 25 million viewers this past year.
</S><S s_id="28">
And however much his audience had aged -- the median age of a Jennings viewer this past season was about 60, according to Nielsen -- advertisers still spend in excess of $100 million annually on each of the evening news programs.
</S><S s_id="29">
Like Brokaw, Rather and now Williams, Jennings was well paid for his efforts: he earned an estimated $10 million a year in recent years.
</S><S s_id="30">
(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</S><S s_id="31">
His most recent contract with the network was due to expire later this year, but at least until he took ill, the network was preparing to extend Jennings' time in the anchor chair for "several years to come," according to David Westin, president of ABC News.
</S><S s_id="32">
Jennings' broadcast training had begun at an astonishingly young age, a function at least partly of his pedigree.
</S><S s_id="33">
Peter Charles Jennings was born July 29, 1938, in Toronto.
</S><S s_id="34">
His father, Charles, was a senior executive of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and a pioneer in Canadian radio news.
</S><S s_id="35">
In "The Century" (Doubleday, 1998), one of two coffee-table-worthy history books that he cowrote with Todd Brewster, Jennings recalled an early exercise that his father put him through in an effort to sharpen his powers of observation.
</S><S s_id="36">
"Describe the sky," his father had said.
</S><S s_id="37">
After the young boy had done so, his father dispatched him outside again.
</S><S s_id="38">
"Now, go out and slice it into pieces and describe each piece as different from the next."
</S><S s_id="39">
By age 9, he had his own show on Canadian radio, "Peter's Program."
</S><S s_id="40">
He dropped out of high school at 17, and by his early 20s was the host of a dance show similar to "American Bandstand" called "Club Thirteen."
</S><S s_id="41">
His rise to the pinnacle of Canadian television news, and later its far larger counterpart to the south, was swift.
</S><S s_id="42">
In 1962, at age 24, he was named co-anchor of the national newscast on CTV, a competitor of his father's network, a job that he held until 1964.
</S><S s_id="43">
That year, he moved to the United States to begin work as a correspondent for ABC.
</S><S s_id="44">
Barely a year later, the network named him an anchor of "ABC Evening News," then a 15-minute newscast, which put him -- at age 26 -- head-to-head with Walter Cronkite on CBS and the formidable tandem of Chet Huntley and David Brinkley on NBC.
</S><S s_id="45">
Though he would serve ABC in that capacity for nearly three years, Jennings said in an interview last year that he was ill-suited for the job and unhappy in it.
</S><S s_id="46">
"I had the good sense to quit," he said.
</S><S s_id="47">
What followed was more than a decade of postings abroad as a foreign correspondent for ABC, during which, Jennings said last year, he got an on-the-job introduction to the world with a tuition bill effectively footed by his employer.
</S><S s_id="48">
"I have no formal education to speak of," Jennings said.
</S><S s_id="49">
"ABC has been my education and provided my education.
</S><S s_id="50">
ABC has enabled me to work everywhere in the world and has ended up paying me beyond handsomely."
</S><S s_id="51">
From 1968 to 1978, Jennings traveled extensively, including to Vietnam, Munich, Germany (where he covered the hostage-taking at the 1972 Summer Olympics), and Beirut, Lebanon (where he established the network's first news bureau in the Arab world.)
</S><S s_id="52">
In 1978, he began his second tour as an anchor for the network, serving as one of three hosts of "World News Tonight," along with Frank Reynolds and Max Robinson, in a format devised by Roone Arledge, the legendary sports programmer who had added the news division to his portfolio.
</S><S s_id="53">
Jennings was the program's foreign anchor, and reported from London until 1983.
</S><S s_id="54">
Three weeks after Reynolds died following a battle with bone cancer, Jennings was named the sole anchor (and managing editor) of the broadcast, titles that Mr. Jennings continued to hold at his death.
</S><S s_id="55">
As an anchor, Jennings presented himself as a worldly alternative to Brokaw's plain-spoken Midwestern manner and Mr. Rather's folksy, if at times offbeat, Southern charm.
</S><S s_id="56">
He neither spoke like many of his viewers ("about" came out of his mouth as a-BOOT, a remnant of his Canadian roots) nor looked like them, with a matinee-idol face and crisply tailored wardrobe that were frequently likened in print to those of James Bond.
</S><S s_id="57">
Though his bearing could be stiff on the air (and his syntax so simplistic at times as to border on patronizing), Jennings was immensely popular with his audience.
</S><S s_id="58">
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</S><S s_id="59">
During a trip last fall through Kansas, Pennsylvania and Ohio in the weeks before the presidential election, he traveled at times aboard a coach customized by the news division to trumpet its campaign coverage and frequently received a rock star's welcome when he decamped.
</S><S s_id="60">
For example, in the parking lot of a deli just outside of Pittsburgh, where he had come to interview a long-shot candidate for Congress whose threadbare headquarters was upstairs, Jennings found himself on the receiving end of several hugs from loyal viewers.
</S><S s_id="61">
"He's so handsome," one of those viewers, Vilma Berryman, 66, the deli owner, observed immediately after meeting him.
</S><S s_id="62">
"He's taller than I thought.
</S><S s_id="63">
He speaks so softly."
</S><S s_id="64">
Like all of the Big 3, Jennings was not without his detractors.
</S><S s_id="65">
Among his critics were those who contended he was too soft on the air when describing the Palestinian cause or the regime of the Cuban leader Fidel Castro -- accusations he disputed.
</S><S s_id="66">
Similarly, an article published in July 2004 in the National Review portrayed him as a thinly veiled opponent of the American war in Iraq.
</S><S s_id="67">
The article quoted Jennings as saying: "That is simply not the way I think of this role.
</S><S s_id="68">
This role is designed to question the behavior of government officials on behalf of the public."
</S><S s_id="69">
Jennings was conscious of having been imbued, during his Canadian boyhood, with a skepticism about American behavior; at least partly as a result, he often delighted in presenting the opinions of those in the minority, whatever the situation.
</S><S s_id="70">
And yet, he simultaneously carried on an elaborate love affair with America, one that reached its apex in the summer of 2003, when he announced that he had become an American citizen, scoring, he said proudly, 100 percent on his citizenship test.
</S><S s_id="71">
In a toast around that time that he gave at the new National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, he described his adopted home as "this brash and noble container of dreams, this muse to artists and inventors and entrepreneurs, this beacon of optimism, this dynamo of energy, this trumpet blare of liberty."
</S><S s_id="72">
Jennings' personal life was at times grist for the gossip pages, including his three divorces.
</S><S s_id="73">
His third wife, the author Kati Marton, whom he married in 1979 and divorced in 1993, is the mother of his two children, who survive him.
</S><S s_id="74">
They are a daughter, Elizabeth, and son, Christopher.
</S><S s_id="75">
He is also survived by his fourth wife, Kayce Freed, a former ABC television producer whom he married in December 1997.
</S><S s_id="76">
Having prided himself on rarely taking a sick day in nearly 40 years -- and being dismissive, at times, of those high-paid colleagues who did -- Jennings had missed the broadcast and the newsroom terribly in recent months.
</S><S s_id="77">
In a letter posted on April 29 on the ABC news Web site, excerpts of which were read on that night's evening news, Jennings described how treatments for his cancer had proven more debilitating than he had anticipated.
</S><S s_id="78">
"Yesterday I decided to go to the office," he wrote.
</S><S s_id="79">
"I live only a few blocks away.
</S><S s_id="80">
I got as far as the door.
</S><S s_id="81">
Chemo strikes."
</S><S s_id="82">
"Do I detect a knowing but sympathetic smile on many of your faces?" he added.
</S><S s_id="83">
About a month later, Jennings did make a rare visit to the ABC News headquarters on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
</S><S s_id="84">
With a gray sweater draped over his shoulders, and his feet clad in thick wool socks and moccasins, Jennings held court for about a half-hour late one morning from his desk, in what is known as "the rim," a newsroom one floor below the "World News Tonight" studio.
</S><S s_id="85">
His voice soft and his body as much as 20 pounds lighter than usual, Jennings told several dozen staff members who had gathered around his desk about the doctors and other patients he had been meeting and of a first-time radiation treatment that he had just received, according to one veteran correspondent who did not wish to be identified so as not to offend Jennings' family.
</S><S s_id="86">
Jennings brought himself and many of his colleagues to tears when he turned to Charles Gibson, one of his two principal substitutes on the program, and thanked him for closing each night's broadcast with the phrase, "for Peter Jennings and all of us at ABC News."
</S><S s_id="87">
Jennings then put his hand over his heart and said, "That means so much to me," according to his colleague.
</S><S s_id="88">
But whatever maudlin feelings were in the air quickly evaporated, Jennings' longtime colleague recounted, when the anchor brandished a familiar black calligraphy pen and began marking up the rundown for that night's broadcast.
</S><S s_id="89">
"No, that's not a good one," he could be overheard telling Jonathan Banner, the program's executive producer, about one segment.
</S><S s_id="90">
Of another, he added, "You want to move this higher up."
</S><S s_id="91">
For his closest colleagues, the reassuring sight of the anchor-as-editor provided a fleeting moment of normalcy in what had been a disorienting and heartbreaking few months.

FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES CELEBRATE THE LIFE OF PETER JENNINGS

FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES CELEBRATE THE LIFE OF PETER JENNINGS
</S><S s_id="1">
Peter Jennings, the ABC News anchor who died last month, was recalled as a devoted father, hard-driving journalist and a man who befriended homeless people, during a service at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday.
</S><S s_id="2">
The service was sprinkled with reflections from Jennings' colleagues at ABC, his two children and friends, like the actor Alan Alda.
</S><S s_id="3">
Because Jennings was a music lover, there was music, too, with selections that included bagpipers escorted by members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Wynton Marsalis on trumpet and a cello solo by Yo-Yo Ma.
</S><S s_id="4">
"We're left now with just a little bit of snow at the bottom of the screen," Alda said in describing Jennings as irreplaceable.
</S><S s_id="5">
He was a "truly authentic" person who conveyed his mix of graciousness, candor and concern to the millions who watched him as anchor of "World News Tonight," Alda said.
</S><S s_id="6">
He never left Jennings' home without a book in tow, Alda recalled, and Jennings -- a Canadian who became a U.S. citizen -- always carried a copy of the Constitution.
</S><S s_id="7">
Others recalled Jennings' fondness for canoeing, his way of putting people at ease and his heart-on-his-sleeve sentimentality.
</S><S s_id="8">
He was, they said, a friend who stuck around for life's inevitable heartbreaks.
</S><S s_id="9">
"He never, ever let us down," said Charles Glass, a journalist who helped Jennings cover the Arab-Israeli war for ABC.
</S><S s_id="10">
With lines stretching around the block, the two-hour service attracted ordinary people paying their respects, ABC and Walt Disney Co. executives and colleagues who included Ted Koppel, Barbara Walters, Diane Sawyer, Larry King, Jon Stewart and Katie Couric.
</S><S s_id="11">
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani also attended, as did Al Sharpton.
</S><S s_id="12">
Photographs of Jennings, often with friends or with his children, Christopher and Elizabeth Jennings, were flashed on a big screen in the cavernous Stern Auditorium.
</S><S s_id="13">
Jennings, one of the most recognizable journalists on American television, died on Aug. 7 from lung cancer.
</S><S s_id="14">
He was 67 years old.
</S><S s_id="15">
Koppel drew laughter throughout his remarks.
</S><S s_id="16">
He facetiously announced that he was not gay, but then said that during their 41-year friendship he was keenly aware of his friend's extraordinary charisma.
</S><S s_id="17">
"I felt a thrill whenever I saw him," he said.
</S><S s_id="18">
He continued: "Peter was notoriously attractive to women.
</S><S s_id="19">
Even so, he only married four of them."
</S><S s_id="20">
Robert A. Iger, president of the Walt Disney Co., remembered Jennings' "uncanny ability to entertain and to inform," as the primary face of ABC during significant world events.
</S><S s_id="21">
At the same time, during a recent lunch, Jennings agreed with him that nothing was more satisfying than seeing their children grow up, Iger said.
</S><S s_id="22">
Tom Nagorski, the producer of "World News Tonight," said Jennings' former staffers now wear plastic blue bracelets that say, "What would Peter do?"
</S><S s_id="23">
Jennings was forever arranging and rearranging his staff's personal and professional lives, he said.
</S><S s_id="24">
He even chided Nagorski, then the foreign editor, for planning his wedding at the same time as the elections in South Africa.
</S><S s_id="25">
Then, with characteristic good cheer, Jennings offered to help with wedding plans, he said.
</S><S s_id="26">
Jennings' widow, Kayce Freed, has been stopped in recent weeks by numerous homeless people offering their condolences, said Mary Brosnahan Sullivan, executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless.
</S><S s_id="27">
For the homeless, Jennings delivered meals, inquired about their lives and donated money to organizations, Sullivan said.
</S><S s_id="28">
Christopher Jennings said his father integrated his children into his world, taking them to his office and on assignment, soliciting their viewpoints.
</S><S s_id="29">
Jennings was often described as cosmopolitan, he said, but he was also a man who always cherished "the ability to be awed."

ABC 5-decade anchor dies of cancer
</S><S s_id="1">
ABC News anchor Peter Jennings died of lung cancer at the age of 67 on Sunday, his company said.
</S><S s_id="2">
The Canadian-born broadcaster who delivered the news to Americans each night in five separate decades died at his New York home, said ABC News President David Westin late Sunday.
</S><S s_id="3">
Jennings announced in April that he had lung cancer and would begin treatment.
</S><S s_id="4">
Although he occasionally came to the office after his diagnosis, he never again appeared on the air.
</S><S s_id="5">
Jennings anchored ABC's World News Tonight for more than 20 years.
</S><S s_id="6">
Jennings, the face of the ABC News, logged more than 60 hours on the air during the week of the terrorist attacks in the United States on Sept. 11, 2001.
