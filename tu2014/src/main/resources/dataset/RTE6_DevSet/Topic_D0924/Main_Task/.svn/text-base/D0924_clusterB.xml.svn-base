Merck disputes Lancet report on Vioxx
</S><S s_id="1">
US pharmaceutical giant Merck on Friday disputed the conclusion of the British medical weekly The Lancet that the arthritis drug Vioxx should have been pulled from the market four years earlier.
</S><S s_id="2">
Merck said it posted a scientific critique on its website "to further clarify for the scientific community why Merck disagrees with the conclusions" of The Lancet.
</S><S s_id="3">
The Lancet report said there was enough evidence four years ago linking the drug to an increased risk of strokes and heart attacks.
</S><S s_id="4">
Merck claimed however that "it was vigilant in monitoring and disclosing the cardiovascular safety" of Vioxx and added that the company "absolutely disagrees with any implication to the contrary."
</S><S s_id="5">
The statement said the scientific critique details why Merck disagrees with analysis of The Lancet and added that until a study this year, "data from Merck's clinical trials showed no significant difference in cardiovascular risk" of Vioxx.
</S><S s_id="6">
The British journal strongly criticized the US drug company, which withdrew the drug from the market in September, for failing to stop marketing the drug in 2000 when data showed Vioxx was potentially dangerous.
</S><S s_id="7">
"The licensing of Vioxx and its continued use in the face of unambiguous evidence of harm have been public health catastrophes," editor Richard Horton said in a commentary.
</S><S s_id="8">
"This controversy will not end with the drug's withdrawal."
</S><S s_id="9">
Merck withdrew Vioxx based on the results of an internal three-year study of 2,600 patients, half of whom received a 25 milligram dose of Vioxx and half of whom received a placebo.

Merck shares slide on civil, criminal probes into Vioxx
</S><S s_id="1">
Drugs giant Merck and Co.'s shares slumped Tuesday after the firm revealed civil and criminal investigations into the sale of its pain drug Vioxx.
</S><S s_id="2">
In the first half hour of trade, Merck shares dropped 55 cents, or 2.1 percent, to 26.02 dollars, completing a 42.3 percent plunge in the past six weeks.
</S><S s_id="3">
In a public filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday, Merck said it had been told of an informal SEC inquiry into Vioxx.
</S><S s_id="4">
The firm said it had also received a subpoena from the US Department of Justice asking for information about its research, marketing and sales of Vioxx in a criminal health care investigation.
</S><S s_id="5">
"The company will cooperate with the SEC and the Justice Department," Merck said in the filing.
</S><S s_id="6">
"The company cannot predict the outcome of these inquiries; however, it is possible that highly unfavorable outcomes, including a potential civil disposition from the SEC and/or potential civil or criminal dispositions from the Justice Department, could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position, liquidity and results of operations," it said.
</S><S s_id="7">
Merck pulled the 2.5-billion-dollar-a-year seller Vioxx off the market on September 30, when an internal study found it doubled the risk of heart attack and stroke after 18 months of continuous use.
</S><S s_id="8">
A study sponsored by the US Food and Drug Administration estimated that Vioxx could have caused 27,785 heart attacks or deaths since it was approved in 1999.
</S><S s_id="9">
Merck has disputed a report in the British medical weekly The Lancet, however, that there was enough evidence four years ago linking the drug to an increased risk of strokes and heart attacks.
</S><S s_id="10">
A rash of lawsuits now plagues the firm because of the global Vioxx withdrawal.
</S><S s_id="11">
Merck said it was unsure if its insurance would provide enough money to cover potential lawsuit losses.

FDA expert accuses agency of hiding potential dangers of Vioxx

FDA expert accuses agency of hiding potential dangers of Vioxx
</S><S s_id="1">
An expert with the Federal Drug Administration on Thursday accused the agency in Congress of having pressed him to withhold results of a study showing potential dangers of the anti-inflammatory drug Vioxx.
</S><S s_id="2">
"I was pressured to change my conclusions and recommendations, and basically threatened that if I did not change them, I would not be permitted to present the paper at the conference," said David Graham, Associate Director for Science with the office of Drug Safety at the FDA.
</S><S s_id="3">
Graham testified Thursday at a Senate hearing about his 2001-2004 study.
</S><S s_id="4">
"One drug safety manager recommended that I should be barred from presenting the poster at the meeting and also noted that Merck needed to know our study results," he said.
</S><S s_id="5">
Merck, the maker of Vioxx, which was approved by the FDA in 1999, voluntarily took the drug off the market in September.
</S><S s_id="6">
Merck withdrew Vioxx based on the results of an internal three-year study of 2,600 patients, half of whom received a 25 mg dose of Vioxx and half of whom received a placebo.
</S><S s_id="7">
The company said these patients, treated with Vioxx to thwart the resurgence of colorectal polyps, a common precursor to cancer, showed no undesirable effects during the first 18 months of the study begun in 2000.
</S><S s_id="8">
However, said Peter Kim, president of Merck Research Laboratory, "while the cause of these results is uncertain at this time, they suggest an increased risk of confirmed cardiovascular events beginning after 18 months of continuous therapy."
</S><S s_id="9">
Graham said: "the problem you are confronting today is immense in scope.
</S><S s_id="10">
Vioxx is a terrible tragedy and a profound regulatory failure.
</S><S s_id="11">
I would argue that the FDA, as currently configured, is incapable of protecting America against another Vioxx."
</S><S s_id="12">
"The corporate culture within CDRE is also a barrier to effectively protecting the American people from unecessary harm due to prescription," he said.

Merck is target of probe over Vioxx recall
</S><S s_id="1">
Drug maker Merck &amp; Co. said that the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department are looking into the company's handling of Vioxx, the blockbuster arthritis drug it pulled off the market Sept. 30 after safety studies showed it increased the risk of heart attacks.
</S><S s_id="2">
In a regulatory filing Tuesday, Merck said the company is the subject of a criminal investigation from the Justice Department, which subpoenaed documents on the company's research, marketing and selling activities for Vioxx.
</S><S s_id="3">
The company estimates 105 million prescriptions were written for the drug for 20 million patients in the United States from May 1999 to August 2004.
</S><S s_id="4">
In 2003, Vioxx had U.S. sales of about $1.8 billion.
</S><S s_id="5">
The SEC also told the company it was beginning its own informal inquiry regarding the drug.
</S><S s_id="6">
Merck said it has also received a letter from the attorneys general in five states stating that its return and refund program for unused Vioxx will not provide consumers with adequate notice and will be unduly burdensome.
</S><S s_id="7">
Merck said that it will cooperate with all information requests and investigations.
</S><S s_id="8">
Shares of Merck fell 43 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $26.14 in the extended session after closing up 36 cents to $26.57 on the New York Stock Exchange.

EARLIER MERCK STUDY INDICATED RISKS OF VIOXX

EARLIER MERCK STUDY INDICATED RISKS OF VIOXX
</S><S s_id="1">
Nearly a year before Merck received results from the clinical trial that prompted the company to pull its painkiller Vioxx from the market, the company received preliminary results from a separate study of patient records that also apparently indicated the drug posed cardiovascular risks.
</S><S s_id="2">
Merck has not publicly disclosed that separate study's results or referred to it in any of its recent statements about Vioxx's safety record since announcing in late September that it would stop selling the drug.
</S><S s_id="3">
But a company spokeswoman, in response to a reporter's questions Wednesday, confirmed the study's existence and said that Merck, which paid for the research, had received its preliminary results last November -- and was given a final report 10 days before the company announced it would stop selling Vioxx.
</S><S s_id="4">
Joan Wainwright, the Merck spokeswoman, said that the separate study, because it was based on patient records and not on an actual clinical trial, was inconclusive and had no bearing on the decision to withdraw Vioxx.
</S><S s_id="5">
When it withdrew the drug from the market, Merck cited a long-term trial showing that some patients, after taking Vioxx for 18 months, developed serious cardiovascular problems.
</S><S s_id="6">
But Merck's critics continue to say that the company should have heeded signals years earlier that Vioxx might pose dangers.
</S><S s_id="7">
The company's chief executive, Raymond V. Gilmartin, is expected to be interrogated on the matter on Thursday in a hearing by the Senate Finance Committee, which will also be examining the Food and Drug Administration's handling of Vioxx and other drug safety issues.
</S><S s_id="8">
The study report that Merck received on Sept. 20 was an analysis of patient records from the UnitedHealth Group.
</S><S s_id="9">
It compared the relative rates of heart attack and stroke in people taking Vioxx, a similar drug Celebrex and traditional over-the-counter painkillers.
</S><S s_id="10">
Wainwright said that the company, as a matter of policy, did not discuss study findings before their public release.
</S><S s_id="11">
But one person who was briefed on the data and who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that the results indicated that Vioxx posed an increased risk of cardiovascular problems, compared with the other drugs studied.
</S><S s_id="12">
Wainwright said that the study had been submitted for potential publication in a medical journal that she declined to identify and that there had been no intentional effort to delay disclosing the results.
</S><S s_id="13">
The Senate hearing comes after the disclosure in recent weeks of internal Merck documents that suggest that the company may have side-stepped questions about Vioxx's safety for several years and used hardball marketing tactics to allay doctors' concerns about the painkiller.
</S><S s_id="14">
An FDA drug reviewer, Dr. David Graham, has claimed that agency superiors discounted his efforts to call attention to the drug's problems.
</S><S s_id="15">
Graham's main evidence is a study of patient records from the Kaiser Permanente health care system, which is similar in approach to the UnitedHealth Care study that Merck commissioned.

MERCK IS TARGET OF FEDERAL LAWSUIT BY NEW YORK PENSION FUND

MERCK IS TARGET OF FEDERAL LAWSUIT BY NEW YORK PENSION FUND
</S><S s_id="1">
The pension fund of New York State filed a federal lawsuit Monday against Merck &amp; Co. that accused Merck of misleading shareholders about the safety of its now-withdrawn arthritis pain drug, Vioxx.
</S><S s_id="2">
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Trenton, N.J., said that the pension fund lost about $171 million on Sept. 30 when the company, citing increased heart risks in tests of people using the drug for more than 18 months, withdrew it from the market.
</S><S s_id="3">
On that day, the price of a share of Merck stock plummeted 27 percent.
</S><S s_id="4">
Merck shares are down about 40 percent for the year, but closed up 35 cents Monday, at $28.02.
</S><S s_id="5">
The lawsuit appears to be the first by a pension fund against Merck.
</S><S s_id="6">
A spokeswoman for Merck, Joan Wainwright, said that about 15 lawsuits had been filed asserting that the company misled shareholders have been filed.
</S><S s_id="7">
Merck is based in Whitehouse Station, N.J Several hundred personal injury lawsuit have also been filed against Merck by people claiming to have been injured Vioxx.
</S><S s_id="8">
The company has denied any wrongdoing.
</S><S s_id="9">
In a statement issued Monday, the New York State comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, maintained that Merck knew, but failed to disclose, that a growing body of evidence indicated that users of Vioxx were at increasing risk of suffering heart attacks, strokes and death.
</S><S s_id="10">
"Merck must be held legally responsible for its actions," said Hevesi, who is also the pension fund's trustee.
</S><S s_id="11">
"These actions have put lives at risk and cost shareholders billions of dollars."
</S><S s_id="12">
In the lawsuit, Hevesi is seeking unspecified monetary damages.
</S><S s_id="13">
Along with the company, the lawsuit names several individuals including the chief executive, Raymond V. Gilmartin.
</S><S s_id="14">
Merck executives have disputed suggestions that they acted improperly and said that they moved promptly to withdraw Vioxx from the market after patients in a clinical trial experienced an increased rate of cardiovascular problems after 18 months of using the drug.
</S><S s_id="15">
""Merck extensively studied Vioxx before seeking regulatory approval to market it," the spokeswoman, Wainwright, said.
</S><S s_id="16">
"We promptly disclosed the clinical data about Vioxx.
</S><S s_id="17">
When questions arose, we took additional steps, including conducting further prospective, controlled studies to gain more clinical information."
</S><S s_id="18">
She said that Merck had not seen Hevesi's lawsuit and could not comment.
</S><S s_id="19">
In his lawsuit, Hevesi cited recent newspaper reports, broadcast reports and medical journal articles that have raised questions about Merck's handling of safety issues surrounding Vioxx.
</S><S s_id="20">
The safety questions first emerged soon after Vioxx was approved in 1999 for sale by federal regulators.
</S><S s_id="21">
In 2000, for instance, a major clinical trial of the drug found that those taking it had a fivefold increased risk of heart attack compared to patients in the trial who took a comparative pain reliever, naproxen.
</S><S s_id="22">
However, until recently, Merck executives said that those results did not reflect any dangers posed by Vioxx but rather that the cardioprotective effect of naproxen.
</S><S s_id="23">
John Chartier, a spokesman for Hevesi, said that at end of September the New York State pension fund owned about 9.4 million shares of Merck.
</S><S s_id="24">
In the lawsuit filed Monday in Trenton, Hevesi is asking the court to consolidate all securities-related claims against Merck in connection with Vioxx into a single class action and to make him the lead plaintiff.
</S><S s_id="25">
He also filed a separate but related lawsuit Monday in U.S. District Court in New Orleans.
</S><S s_id="26">
The New York State Common Retirement Fund, as the pension fund is officially known, is the second-largest public pension fund in the country after the California fund.
</S><S s_id="27">
It has approximately $120.8 billion in assets and more than 970,000 retirees, beneficiaries and members.
