LAST PIECE OF TRADE CENTER PUZZLE MAY NOT BE AN EASY FIT

LAST PIECE OF TRADE CENTER PUZZLE MAY NOT BE AN EASY FIT
</S><S s_id="1">
The clock ran out last week for public comments on New York state's plan to condemn almost an entire block south of ground zero, the last parcel needed for the full redevelopment of the World Trade Center site.
</S><S s_id="2">
Conspicuously absent from the comments submitted to the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. was any objection from the Milstein family, owners of the land the state proposes to take.
</S><S s_id="3">
"We're hopeful that we will have a satisfactory resolution soon," said a spokesman for Paul and Howard P. Milstein, father and son, who run Milstein Properties and are co-chairmen of the Emigrant Savings Bank.
</S><S s_id="4">
The Milsteins' conciliatory statement, which is all they will say on the subject, sets the stage for negotiations -- one step ahead of formal condemnation -- over a vital parcel that is to serve as the gateway to the ramps, service roads, loading docks and parking spaces under the future trade center.
</S><S s_id="5">
"We remain hopeful that we'll be able to reach a negotiated settlement," Kevin M. Rampe, president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corp., said Wednesday.
</S><S s_id="6">
Known on city maps as Block 56, this parallelogram-shaped property is bounded by Liberty, Washington, Cedar and West Streets.
</S><S s_id="7">
The Milsteins own all but the lot on which St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church stood until it was crushed by 2 World Trade Center.
</S><S s_id="8">
But the Milsteins have been unable to use their land since Sept. 11, 2001.
</S><S s_id="9">
Today, Block 56 is controlled by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
</S><S s_id="10">
It serves as a parking lot, staging area and roadway into the trade center site.
</S><S s_id="11">
The Milsteins bought their 20,000-square-foot property in 1978.
</S><S s_id="12">
In 1981, they announced plans for a 35-story, 400,000-square-foot office building, to be called 1 World Plaza, or 140 Liberty Street.
</S><S s_id="13">
Designed by the Vilkas Group, it would have been connected at the second-story level with a pedestrian bridge to 1 Bankers Trust Plaza, which was later known as the Deutsche Bank building.
</S><S s_id="14">
There was no market for that project, but the Milsteins kept exploring possibilities.
</S><S s_id="15">
They tried to acquire the St. Nicholas property, going so far as to discuss projects in which they would construct a new sanctuary for the Greek Orthodox Church in the base of a larger building.
</S><S s_id="16">
More recently, they had focused on residential or hotel development.
</S><S s_id="17">
Meanwhile, the site was used as a parking lot.
</S><S s_id="18">
Control of the property was assumed by the City Department of Design and Construction after Sept. 11, 2001.
</S><S s_id="19">
The city then passed control to the Port Authority.
</S><S s_id="20">
The authority has never entered into a lease or other agreement with the Milsteins, although there were some discussions in 2002.
</S><S s_id="21">
The authority has not paid any money to the Milsteins for using this block.
</S><S s_id="22">
(The church property will not be taken by eminent domain but swapped for a larger parcel nearby on which a new sanctuary and interdenominational center will be built.)
</S><S s_id="23">
The planners of the trade center site originally envisioned that Block 56 would be part of the new Liberty Park, with St. Nicholas Church at its west end.
</S><S s_id="24">
The ramp to the underground roadways was to be on the north side of Liberty Street.
</S><S s_id="25">
Plans now call for the ramp to be on the south side.
</S><S s_id="26">
That permits two-way traffic on Liberty Street and separates what will be a heavily used ramp from the memorial.
</S><S s_id="27">
But the trade center site is an interlocking puzzle.
</S><S s_id="28">
No planning problem can be solved without creating another one.
</S><S s_id="29">
To accommodate trucks and buses, the ramp entrance will need a great deal of headroom; so much that it will force the construction of a 20-foot earthen mound, or berm, in the middle of Liberty Park.
</S><S s_id="30">
This berm could overwhelm the new church and loom over the south end of the memorial plaza.
</S><S s_id="31">
On the other hand, if it were creatively conceived and designed, it might offer a fine vantage from which to view the memorial.
</S><S s_id="32">
Before any of that happens, however, the Milsteins will almost certainly seek compensation for the three-and-a-half years -- and counting -- in which they have been deprived of access to their property.
</S><S s_id="33">
Just how much compensation remains to be seen.
</S><S s_id="34">
They have already turned down a $30 million offer from the development corporation.
</S><S s_id="35">
(Last week, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development approved the corporation's plan to spend $44.5 million to acquire the whole site, including the Milsteins' property.)
</S><S s_id="36">
The Milsteins are also interested in a land swap.
</S><S s_id="37">
It would not take much imagination to conclude that their sights are set on Battery Park City, which is controlled by a state authority.
</S><S s_id="38">
They have already developed four apartment buildings there: Liberty Court, Liberty House, Liberty Terrace and Liberty View.
</S><S s_id="39">
"All options are on the table," Rampe said.

TIMES SQUARE REVIVAL LEADER HEADS GROUND ZERO AGENCY

TIMES SQUARE REVIVAL LEADER HEADS GROUND ZERO AGENCY
</S><S s_id="1">
Gretchen Dykstra, the city consumer affairs commissioner, who previously led the redevelopment of Times Square, was named Thursday as president and chief executive of the foundation charged with raising more than $500 million for a memorial and two cultural buildings at ground zero.
</S><S s_id="2">
The World Trade Center Memorial Foundation was created in December to raise money and run the memorial and the cultural buildings, which include a performing arts center and museum.
</S><S s_id="3">
Its board, which includes David Rockefeller, Robert De Niro,Barbara Walters and Michael D. Eisner, is expected eventually to take over many of the responsibilities of the Lower Manhattan Development Corp., which is overseeing the rebuilding effort at ground zero.
</S><S s_id="4">
"It's important, it's historic, it's unique and it's doable," Dykstra, 57, said of her new job in an interview at the corporation's offices near ground zero.
</S><S s_id="5">
She said she was confident that it would not be hard to drum up financial support -- "not for this event, not for this purpose."
</S><S s_id="6">
"We've got to get moving," she said, adding that the foundation members had "already begun to lay the groundwork."
</S><S s_id="7">
At a news conference at the trade center site after the foundation's second board meeting Thursday, John C. Whitehead, the chairman of the development corporation, said the foundation began its fund-raising effort about two weeks ago and had already received large financial commitments.
</S><S s_id="8">
He said that by large gifts he meant pledges of $10 million to $25 million.
</S><S s_id="9">
Dykstra was selected from about 12 candidates, Whitehead said, because "she has all the qualities we were looking for in a president."
</S><S s_id="10">
Dykstra said she would start in her new post next month.
</S><S s_id="11">
She will face the challenge of balancing the competing concerns of the parties involved at ground zero, including city and state officials, families of those who died in the Sept. 11 attacks, downtown residents, real estate developers and big-name architects.
</S><S s_id="12">
That may be what she had in mind Thursday when she said it was important "to make sure the process of getting there also makes us proud."
</S><S s_id="13">
"There are a lot of players," she added, "a lot of pressures."
</S><S s_id="14">
Plans call for the performing arts center to be shared by the Joyce Theater, which presents dance, and the Signature Theater Company, an off-Broadway company.
</S><S s_id="15">
The museum is to be shared by the Freedom Center, a nascent organization that plans to focus on human rights exhibitions, and the Drawing Center, which presents drawing shows in SoHo.
</S><S s_id="16">
But prospects for all four groups remain murky given that the development corporation has yet to say how much it will contribute toward the groups' construction and operating costs and how much they will have to provide.
</S><S s_id="17">
The corporation has delayed its announcement of a design of the performing arts center, by the architect Frank Gehry, citing complications related to fitting both the Joyce and the Signature into a single building with limited space.
</S><S s_id="18">
Whitehead spoke of the performing arts center as part of a "second phase" with a separate fund-raising goal of "roughly $200 million"; the first $500 million will cover the memorial, a memorial center and the museum component, which includes the Freedom Center and Drawing Center.
</S><S s_id="19">
The development corporation later said the $200 million figure was uncertain until a design was completed.
</S><S s_id="20">
The corporation also has delayed releasing a design of the museum building by the Norwegian architecture firm Snohetta, citing details still to be resolved.
</S><S s_id="21">
In addition, the design of the memorial itself has been complicated by the fact that three different architectural firms are involved.
</S><S s_id="22">
Born on Staten Island and raised in Philadelphia, Dykstra received her bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin and a master's in education and an honorary doctorate from the Bank Street College of Education.

CONTROVERSY CONTINUES OVER SEPT. 11 MEMORIAL

CONTROVERSY CONTINUES OVER SEPT. 11 MEMORIAL
</S><S s_id="1">
As the focus at ground zero has suddenly veered to the Freedom Tower and the rough-and-tumble blame game involving its security redesign, the most vocal members of a powerful constituency -- the Sept. 11, 2001, families -- have seized the hour to be heard above the growing clamor of politicians, developers, architects, cultural administrators, community advocates and other Lower Manhattan stakeholders.
</S><S s_id="2">
Family members of the 2,749 World Trade Center victims, and other interested parties, have until 5 p.m. Friday to formally express their concerns about the memorial's evolving design.
</S><S s_id="3">
That witching hour officially halts the period of public commentary on a new round of amendments to the reconstruction effort's originally approved environmental assessment.
</S><S s_id="4">
September's Mission and several other family groups have objected to many of the announced amendments, among them reducing the number of pedestrian ramps into the memorial to two from four.
</S><S s_id="5">
They say that this would re-create the claustrophobic experience of fleeing from the Twin Towers, and that it would pose a hazard if the projected 2,000 visitors per hour had to exit in an emergency.
</S><S s_id="6">
At least eight of the dozens of Trade Center groups have blitzed hundreds of families with e-mail messages encouraging them to "Make Sure That the Families' Voices Are Heard," as one of the entreaties put it.
</S><S s_id="7">
"We feel it's now or never," said the executive director of the World Trade Center United Family Group, Anthony Gardner, whose brother, Harvey Joseph Gardner III, died in the north tower.
</S><S s_id="8">
"People are putting egos aside, and we've come together again, because we feel the memorial concerns are being ignored.
</S><S s_id="9">
Originally the memorial was the heart of the site, and now it's getting less and less important."
</S><S s_id="10">
The founder of September's Mission, Monica Iken, whose husband, Michael, died in the south tower, said that "everyone is talking about the Freedom Tower, but the memorial is all that many of us will have of our loved ones, and it has to be done right."
</S><S s_id="11">
Kevin M. Rampe, the president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which is overseeing the project and the public-comment process, said of the changes that "the reason the number of ramps was reduced from four to two was that our consultants told us that was the best way to provide security there."
</S><S s_id="12">
Beyond that, he said, the importance of the Trade Center memorial has been undiminished.
</S><S s_id="13">
And, he added, some of the family critics were using the environmental-comment period "as an opportunity to rehash issues that have been out there since the beginning."
</S><S s_id="14">
Some of the family groups insist on direct access to the Trade Center bedrock at the tower footprints, considering it sacred ground that offers the only connection to their loved ones, since the remains of 42 percent of the victims -- including those of Iken's and Gardner's relatives -- have not been identified.
</S><S s_id="15">
Current plans appear to require family members to traverse the spaces occupied by tourists and by graphic exhibits about the attack.
</S><S s_id="16">
"We have plans that will allow people to have access to bedrock and the columns separately," said Michael Arad, the architect who designed the memorial.
</S><S s_id="17">
"We have met with the families every step of the way," he said, "and we will continue to."
</S><S s_id="18">
Other design criticism from family groups centers around the streetwalls -- or heights of buildings facing the streets -- which, according to the proposed site changes, could be as high as 150 feet, a prospect that could be "forbidding and unwelcoming" to pedestrians, Iken said, "and could detract from the memorial, shadowing it."
</S><S s_id="19">
To Rampe, though, "the streetwall height is exactly the same as across the street at the World Financial Center."
</S><S s_id="20">
"This was an aesthetic decision," he added, "to make it correspond with surrounding architecture."
</S><S s_id="21">
Arad said, "We are trying to give the memorial quadrant a strong definition, so it can be a counterpoint to the development around it."
</S><S s_id="22">
Important elements of the memorial design are now under intensive study in Richmond Hill, Ontario, just north of Toronto.
</S><S s_id="23">
There, a consultant to the memorial-design team has constructed a full-scale mockup of one corner of one of the voids.
</S><S s_id="24">
Water troughs at the upper level empty into a pool below, in a test of one of the most critical elements of the memorial: the walls of water that will cascade down all four sides of each enormous void.
</S><S s_id="25">
Architects are experimenting with ways to reduce noise, splashing, freezing, blowing and clogging.
</S><S s_id="26">
The public commentary process that ends Friday is made mandatory not only by New York State environmental law, but also by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which has awarded $2.78 billion in grants to the Development Corporation for the rebuilding effort.
</S><S s_id="27">
The Development Corporation has the authority to choose among the comments it receives -- some 400 arrived by Thursday -- and the power to enact the changes it sees fit.
</S><S s_id="28">
The public-comment process "is not a meaningless exercise," Rampe said, pointing out that the original plan was altered in many respects, including the access to bedrock and the preservation of Trade Center remnants at the towers' footprints.
</S><S s_id="29">
The family members are highly diverse, and some said that none of the disparate and sometimes fractious Sept. 11 groups could speak for all the families in regard to progress at ground zero.
</S><S s_id="30">
"We never thought it would be smooth sailing, and I think that a lot has been accomplished on the site," said Paula Berry, a member of the Families Advisory Council.
</S><S s_id="31">
"On the whole, the LMDC has done an incredible job, and they have made great effort to be transparent."
</S><S s_id="32">
But Frederic M. Bell, executive director of the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects, echoed charges of some of the family activists in saying that the development corporation "has not put out enough public information for the public to weigh in."
</S><S s_id="33">
"The LMDC garnered input early on," he added, "but that has diminished, and there is not enough public discourse on how the project has evolved."
</S><S s_id="34">
His organization has filed an entry in the public-comment process.
</S><S s_id="35">
Rampe has rejected any extension of the public-comment period, as some family groups requested.
</S><S s_id="36">
But to Bell, "The comment period ends when people stop commenting.
</S><S s_id="37">
So the comment period never ends."
</S><S s_id="38">
In keeping with that reality, some family members are also taking issue with long-known aspects of the project plan, including the prominence of the cultural buildings that, they say, encroach on the memorial.
</S><S s_id="39">
"We've ended up with a memorial that's underground, with a museum that's hovering over the site," said Mary Fetchet, the founding director of Voices of Sept. 11, who lost her son, Bradley, in the south tower.
</S><S s_id="40">
Families are also concerned that visitors will be confused by the International Freedom Center.
</S><S s_id="41">
"You're going to think that's the 9/11 museum," said Edie Lutnick, executive director of the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund.
</S><S s_id="42">
Because the program planned for the center will not be purely commemorative, some say it does not belong there.
</S><S s_id="43">
She and others suggest moving the cultural institutions into the bases of the commercial buildings on the site.
</S><S s_id="44">
"You've got 10 million square feet of unrented office space," Lutnick said.
</S><S s_id="45">
"Put it there."
</S><S s_id="46">
The development corporation has said this is not under consideration.
</S><S s_id="47">
Fetchet said she would urge Gov. George E. Pataki to "take a leadership role and scrutinize what's being done to the memorial."
</S><S s_id="48">
"If the memorial fails," she added, "the governor fails."

WORLD TRADE CENTER SITE REBUILDING PLAGUED BY SETBACKS

WORLD TRADE CENTER SITE REBUILDING PLAGUED BY SETBACKS
</S><S s_id="1">
Uncertainty is looming large at Ground Zero as plans to heal the scars of Sept. 11, 2001 face new setbacks and revisions.
</S><S s_id="2">
The Freedom Tower meant to rise from the World Trade Center's ashes will be redesigned because of security concerns, officials said this week.
</S><S s_id="3">
Plans for a memorial for the terror victims also will likely undergo many changes.
</S><S s_id="4">
This comes amid slowed construction, the resignation of a leading development official, bickering over design and continuing questions about whether so much new office space can be filled in lower Manhattan.
</S><S s_id="5">
Some groups representing victims' families, who faced a Friday deadline to submit public comments on proposed memorial changes, blame government officials and developers for rushing the rebuilding.
</S><S s_id="6">
"The memorial has taken a back seat to the commercial interests," said Anthony Gardner, a board member of the Coalition of 9/11 Families whose brother, Harvey, was killed in the attacks.
</S><S s_id="7">
The coalition opposes many proposed changes, including reducing the number of pedestrian ramps into the memorial from four to two.
</S><S s_id="8">
"They're going to be recreating that claustrophobic sort of environment that was going on during the attack as people were descending the stairwells," Gardner said.
</S><S s_id="9">
Changes to the Freedom Tower could be even more extensive.
</S><S s_id="10">
The skyscraper was envisioned as a twisting 1,776-foot spire of glittering glass and steel, its form evoking the Statue of Liberty's silhouette.
</S><S s_id="11">
But the building is going back to the drawing board, Gov. George Pataki said Wednesday, responding to security concerns from the New York Police Department.
</S><S s_id="12">
One of the worries expressed last month was that the building would be too close to the street and vulnerable to a truck bomb attack.
</S><S s_id="13">
"I have no doubt that (architect) David Childs will come up with yet another magnificent design that will once again inspire the nation and serve as a fitting tribute to freedom," Pataki said.
</S><S s_id="14">
A first look at that new design, which should still reach the same patriotic height, could be released in several weeks, development officials said.
</S><S s_id="15">
The security concerns will likely push back the tower's completion date to at least 2010, a year later than first planned.
</S><S s_id="16">
The emergence of these security issues so recently -- the tower's design was unveiled in December 2003 and the cornerstone laid on the last Fourth of July -- has led to finger-pointing by government officials, with some expressing surprise over the police concerns.
</S><S s_id="17">
Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., while praising Pataki for acting to get the project back on track, had said a day earlier that the rebuilding was "losing steam."
</S><S s_id="18">
"A culture of inertia has infected downtown redevelopment and our city in general, making large public projects like this one nearly impossible to complete," he said.
</S><S s_id="19">
"We seem to be losing our way."
</S><S s_id="20">
Last month, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. suspended plans to build a $2 billion, 40-story headquarters at the site.
</S><S s_id="21">
The state scrapped plans for a nearby traffic tunnel that concerned the company, but the building's future remains in limbo.
</S><S s_id="22">
The planned Freedom Tower and the nearby 7 World Trade Center, which is almost complete, lack major tenants.
</S><S s_id="23">
Adding to this, Kevin Rampe, president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corp., which oversees the rebuilding effort at the World Trade Center site, announced on Monday his resignation effective later this month.
</S><S s_id="24">
Rampe has said his departure was long planned and unrelated to the current redevelopment issues.
</S><S s_id="25">
Schumer warned that continuing delays could put federal funding for the area at risk.
</S><S s_id="26">
He added that while security concerns need to be taken seriously, "the Freedom Tower cannot become a barricaded, windowless fortress -- a dark and uninviting presence in a neighborhood that desperately needs the shops, people and bustle unique to this great city."
</S><S s_id="27">
"The Freedom Tower is more than a building to anchor lower Manhattan," he said.
</S><S s_id="28">
"It is a statement of American resolve."

DESIGNER OF 9/11 MEMORIAL STAYS FOCUSED ON THE GOAL
</HEADLINE><DATELINE>
NEW YORK
</DATELINE><TEXT><S s_id="0">
DESIGNER OF 9/11 MEMORIAL STAYS FOCUSED ON THE GOAL
</S><S s_id="1">
Sometime it's hard to believe that Michael Arad is still in the picture.
</S><S s_id="2">
Bit by bit, elements of his original design for the World Trade Center Memorial have been whittled away, whether because of logistical realities at ground zero (the memorial will be built above PATH train tracks), client demands (the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. is calling the shots), the many other interests involved (the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the site; victims' families; downtown residents) or the assorted architectural cooks (three other firms).
</S><S s_id="3">
For example, Arad included no trees in his original design, which was chosen in January 2004 after a competition.
</S><S s_id="4">
The memorial jury expressed a desire to make his design more green, so he teamed up with the landscape architect Peter Walker.
</S><S s_id="5">
Now Arad is fending off a veritable forest at the site and dealing with how the trees might impinge on the memorial below them.
</S><S s_id="6">
Arad originally designed four ramps leading into and out of the memorial.
</S><S s_id="7">
Now there are two.
</S><S s_id="8">
His reflecting pools were not centered in the footprints of the twin towers.
</S><S s_id="9">
Now they are.
</S><S s_id="10">
Two considerably more experienced architectural firms are taking part in the process: Peter Walker &amp; Partners and Davis Brody Bond.
</S><S s_id="11">
Handel Architects is also involved; Arad, now 35, joined the firm last year to give himself institutional backup.
</S><S s_id="12">
Some planning and design experts marvel that Arad has not been completely marginalized or discouraged.
</S><S s_id="13">
"He may be crumbling internally, but I think he's shown surprising maturity for his tender years," said David J. Burney, the commissioner of the New York City Department of Design and Construction and an architect himself.
</S><S s_id="14">
In a telephone interview yesterday, Arad was cautious in fielding questions about the current state of his design.
</S><S s_id="15">
(Joanna Rose, the development corporation spokeswoman, was in the room on speakerphone.)
</S><S s_id="16">
Asked whether he was satisfied with the two ramps, Arad did not respond.
</S><S s_id="17">
His partner, Gary Edward Handel, piped up, "We're not happy about every decision that's made, but we trust the process."
</S><S s_id="18">
Arad would say only that he was keeping his eye on the finish line.
</S><S s_id="19">
"My role in this is to be the advocate for the memorial," he said.
</S><S s_id="20">
"That is what I do every day in this project."
</S><S s_id="21">
To be sure, the conflicts over the design of the memorial have not brought the architects to a standoff or the process to a standstill, as occurred when David Childs and Daniel Libeskind fought over the design of the Freedom Tower.
</S><S s_id="22">
Indeed, even as the Freedom Tower has become a big question mark at ground zero in terms of what it will look like and when it will be finished, the memorial is proceeding apace.
</S><S s_id="23">
Groundbreaking is expected early next year for an opening on Sept. 11, 2009.
</S><S s_id="24">
The party line is that people are working through their differences and that those differences will make for a better final product.
</S><S s_id="25">
"There's a healthy dialogue and differing opinions," said Kevin M. Rampe, president of the development corporation.
</S><S s_id="26">
"I think that's been great.
</S><S s_id="27">
Each brings their unique experience."
</S><S s_id="28">
Walker is largely concerned with "how the landscape interacts with the memorial," Rampe continued, adding that J.
</S><S s_id="29">
Max Bond Jr. of Davis Brody Bond "brings an enormous wealth of practical experience about engineering considerations, and Michael brings the vision."
</S><S s_id="30">
Despite the varying levels of professional experience, Rampe said Arad had managed to hold his own.
</S><S s_id="31">
"Michael has earned a level of respect," he said.
</S><S s_id="32">
"I don't think one feels they can overwhelm the other.
</S><S s_id="33">
They come with different perspectives, different skills, and ultimately they will end up with good results."
</S><S s_id="34">
The architects largely echoed that assessment.
</S><S s_id="35">
Bond said, "The design benefits from the interaction of the three different firms and the consultants."
</S><S s_id="36">
Walker said, "Sometimes it's heated, sometimes it works very smoothly."
</S><S s_id="37">
Arad said: "It's not about this being a harmonious process.
</S><S s_id="38">
It's about it being a productive process."
</S><S s_id="39">
But some of those involved say Arad was unprepared for the harsh realities of the process -- above all, how much his plan would have to change in light of engineering concerns and competing priorities.
</S><S s_id="40">
"We viewed the competition as the beginning of the evolution," said Douglas Findlay, a partner in the Walker firm.
</S><S s_id="41">
"He often views it as the end."
</S><S s_id="42">
Walker offered, "I'm glad I didn't deal with something of this magnitude at the beginning of my career."
</S><S s_id="43">
He added, "This is the process to end all processes."
</S><S s_id="44">
Arad said he was by no means naive about the logistics involved; in addition to the PATH tracks, a chiller plant lies under the site.
</S><S s_id="45">
"The technical complexity of the site is challenging," he said.
</S><S s_id="46">
"But our team has a thorough grasp of the issues."
</S><S s_id="47">
At the same time, Arad said, his vision for the site remains clear.
</S><S s_id="48">
"I know exactly what I want to see here, and it's just a matter of advocating for the memorial," he said.
</S><S s_id="49">
"I think people understand that and appreciate it."
</S><S s_id="50">
When he won the design competition, Arad was only 34 and had never done anything nearly so big before, let alone at one of the most scrutinized architectural sites in the city's history.
</S><S s_id="51">
After earning his master's degree from Georgia Tech's College of Architecture in 1999, Arad spent three years at Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates, where he worked on projects like Espirito Santo Plaza in Miami and Union Station in Hong Kong.
</S><S s_id="52">
Then he joined the New York City Housing Authority, where he was working on two new police stations when his memorial design was selected.
</S><S s_id="53">
Before becoming an architect, Arad spent three years in the Israeli Army.
</S><S s_id="54">
And he is no stranger to politics or diplomacy: his father, Moshe, served as Israeli ambassador to the United States from 1987 to 1990 and as the ambassador to Mexico from 1983 to 1987.
</S><S s_id="55">
The memorial is expected to cost $350 million, including the Memorial Center, a separate area being designed by Davis Brody Bond that is to include artifacts from the Trade Center.
</S><S s_id="56">
The architects are still in the thick of resolving each of the design details that will make up the memorial, from how much noise and splash the waterfalls will give off to how people will find the names of their loved ones inscribed in stone around the two pools.
</S><S s_id="57">
Most recently, for example, the parties involved have clashed over the number of ramps; the decision to have two instead of four was clearly made over Arad's objections.
</S><S s_id="58">
According to Findlay, the best architects are the ones who "are able to deal with these obstacles and turn them around to make them into something, make them a virtue -- not to resist it," and to keep their eyes open "for the great ideas that flow by."
</S><S s_id="59">
That is not to say that an architect should say yes to everything if he believes it compromises his design, Findlay said.
</S><S s_id="60">
He cited his own objections to the Port Authority's proposal to place a huge vent in the middle of the park.
</S><S s_id="61">
Arad's initial design did not address questions like crowd circulation or security.
</S><S s_id="62">
An information center called Memorial Hall has been added between the two pools.
</S><S s_id="63">
Walker said the experience had deepened his respect for Maya Lin, who designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington.
</S><S s_id="64">
"I've never had the appreciation for her that I have now," he said.
</S><S s_id="65">
"How she got through it and got something that is really good and still has got her head about her -- I think about it all the time."
</S><S s_id="66">
But Findlay emphasized that the ground zero memorial raises different challenges.
</S><S s_id="67">
"This site is where the event occurred," he said, adding, "The memorial is essentially people's grave site."
</S><S s_id="68">
With this in mind, the architects are working on the spiritual aspect of moving through the memorial -- going from the bustle of the secular city into the park into the sobering memorial and up again into the living world.
</S><S s_id="69">
"Imagine walking around a five-acre oak woodland," Findlay said.
</S><S s_id="70">
"You will be drawn into it.
</S><S s_id="71">
You can see across the plain and see the plain go away.
</S><S s_id="72">
You can hear the waterfalls, and at night it glows.
</S><S s_id="73">
So in all ways the voids have been made very important."
</S><S s_id="74">
Nonetheless, some of the Sept. 11 families are unhappy with how the memorial is shaping up.
</S><S s_id="75">
Some want the names of the victims listed alphabetically, or by tower, or by police or fire department affiliation.
</S><S s_id="76">
Some even want the remains of the World Trade Center victims to be moved to the site from the Fresh Kills landfill.
</S><S s_id="77">
"You can't call these people heroes and leave their remains in a garbage dump in Staten Island," said Edie Lutnick, executive director of the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund, set up to aid families of victims who worked for the financial services concern at the World Trade Center.
</S><S s_id="78">
As for creative tensions, some architects say they are to be expected.
</S><S s_id="79">
"You put capable and strong-willed design firms in a room and there is a discussion of options," said Fredric M. Bell, executive director of the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects.
</S><S s_id="80">
"That's how it should be."
</S><S s_id="81">
"I think Michael is a very reasonable and smart and flexible person -- not the type to say, 'I'm taking my marbles and going home,"' he said.
</S><S s_id="82">
At the same time, Bell added: "He does have strong ideas.
</S><S s_id="83">
Winning a competition is incredibly empowering.
</S><S s_id="84">
That's the card that Michael has."

AIDE TO PATAKI IS PUT IN CHARGE AT GROUND ZERO

NEW YORK

AIDE TO PATAKI IS PUT IN CHARGE AT GROUND ZERO
</S><S s_id="1">
Gov. George E. Pataki will appoint his chief of staff to take control of the rebuilding effort in Lower Manhattan, aides to the governor said last night.
</S><S s_id="2">
He will also use hundreds of millions of public dollars to jumpstart the fund-raising effort for the Sept. 11 memorial at the World Trade Center site, they said, and will push ahead the timetable for producing a redesign of the Freedom Tower office building.
</S><S s_id="3">
Pataki, in a speech Thursday to the Association for a Better New York, is to announce that John P. Cahill, one of his closest aides, is set to leave Albany to spend the majority of his time working on the complex multibillion-dollar redevelopment project, and that he will be charged with the power to bring together the disparate agencies and agendas at the site, the aides said.
</S><S s_id="4">
They spoke on the condition of anonymity to preserve relationships with interested parties who had not yet been briefed about the changes.
</S><S s_id="5">
Among Cahill's first priorities will be to lure Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. back to Lower Manhattan.
</S><S s_id="6">
The investment bank recently scrapped plans to build a new $2 billion headquarters across the street from the former World Trade Center site.
</S><S s_id="7">
Pataki, the aides said, will also energize the fund-raising effort for the planned memorial by earmarking $300 million in federal money for construction and maintenance of the complex, which includes a study center, underground exhibits and twin reflecting pools marking the footprints of the twin towers.
</S><S s_id="8">
Finally, Pataki will announce that a new plan for the Freedom Tower, which was deemed vulnerable to a terrorist attack, will be released in one month.
</S><S s_id="9">
Pataki's latest plans amount to his starkest and most public acknowledgement that the large and emotionally delicate effort in Lower Manhattan has suffered serious setbacks in recent weeks.
</S><S s_id="10">
The governor is eager not only to mollify the executives at Goldman Sachs but also to quiet a growing chorus of critics -- from U.S. Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., to business leaders and real estate experts -- who have complained that the project seems derailed.
</S><S s_id="11">
Pataki has long hoped that a rebuilt and prospering downtown would be the cornerstone of his legacy.
</S><S s_id="12">
His third term expires next year, and he has not announced whether he will seek a fourth.
</S><S s_id="13">
"The purpose of the speech is more than an update," one aide to the governor said.
</S><S s_id="14">
"The purpose is to restore confidence in the rebuilding process."
</S><S s_id="15">
The aide added that the lesson that was learned in recent weeks "is that anything can hit a snag, and we don't want things out of control again."
</S><S s_id="16">
To that end, Pataki has assigned Cahill to coordinate the work of each government agency and private institution and to serve as the final word from Albany.
</S><S s_id="17">
Cahill, a lawyer who early in his career handled some real estate and development projects, once served as the head of the State Department of Environmental Conservation and has long been one of the governor's senior policy advisers.
</S><S s_id="18">
All those involved at ground zero will report to Cahill, including the president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the agency set up in the aftermath of Sept. 11 to run the redevelopment.
</S><S s_id="19">
Kevin Rampe recently announced that he would resign as president of the development agency, and his successor has not yet been named.
</S><S s_id="20">
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the Battery Park City Authority and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will also report to Cahill.
</S><S s_id="21">
He will also be the governor's liaison to the city and to private business.
</S><S s_id="22">
A spokesman for Goldman Sachs expressed pleasure.
</S><S s_id="23">
"We have had an excellent relationship with John Cahill," the spokesman, Peter Rose, said.
</S><S s_id="24">
"We think he is the right person to provide leadership to bring the variegated parts of downtown together."
</S><S s_id="25">
Pataki's speech will likely be greeted with some relief as well as skepticism, given that some three and a half years have passed since the trade center attacks.
</S><S s_id="26">
"Timetables and speeches haven't gotten us anywhere so far," said Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who was briefed on the plan Wednesday night.
</S><S s_id="27">
The families of the Sept. 11 victims were one of Pataki's key constituencies as the new plan for the site was developed, and the governor is to make a gesture to that group as he pledges public dollars to build and preserve the memorial.
</S><S s_id="28">
The World Trade Center Memorial Foundation was created in December to raise money and run and preserve the memorial and the nearby cultural buildings.
</S><S s_id="29">
But the foundation, which garnered some private contributions, has also fallen short of the initial expectation of its founders.
</S><S s_id="30">
It only recently named a president and began fund-raising in earnest, and is far short of the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to proceed.
</S><S s_id="31">
Pataki will announce that $300 million of the remaining $800 million in Lower Manhattan Development Corporation funds would go toward the memorial, with $200 million serving as a challenge grant for private donations.

GATHERING MEMORIES OF THE LOST, WHERE THEY DIED

GATHERING MEMORIES OF THE LOST, WHERE THEY DIED
</S><S s_id="1">
Down at the Battery, booklets called "Attack on America," "Tragedy" and "Tragedia" sell for $6, or two for $10.
</S><S s_id="2">
The pictures make the sale, and the pictures are all the same.
</S><S s_id="3">
They tell a story exhaustively told in forests of newsprint, books, government reports, made-for-TV movies and a Bruce Springsteen record.
</S><S s_id="4">
Inside the World Trade Center PATH train station, the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. has commissioned a project to tell the story again, an exercise in populism that takes an approach opposite to that of the photo booklets.
</S><S s_id="5">
The project, a storytelling booth set to open Tuesday, depends on words with no pictures, rambling impressions instead of searing images, the cadence of voices in place of printed text.
</S><S s_id="6">
In part, it is a stopgap for Reflecting Absence, a six-acre memorial scheduled to open in 2009 at the site of the terror attack of 2001.
</S><S s_id="7">
The storytelling idea has won tacit approval from survivors' groups, no mean feat in light of the controversies attached to memorial planning at the city's grimmest tourist attraction.
</S><S s_id="8">
"People have stories to tell; they need to start doing it now," said Monica Iken, the founder of a group called September's Mission and a critic of some memorial plans.
</S><S s_id="9">
"Children are getting older, people are ready to express themselves."
</S><S s_id="10">
Iken lost her husband, Michael, a bond broker, at the World Trade Center.
</S><S s_id="11">
The development corporation paid $350,000 to build the booth and pledged an additional $150,000 to operate it through December.
</S><S s_id="12">
There are plans to install listening stations later on.
</S><S s_id="13">
The project is an extension of work by Story Corps, which began an oral history archive at Grand Central Terminal two years ago.
</S><S s_id="14">
In a sparse recording studio at Vanderbilt Hall and later in mobile booths traveling the country, 3,000 people have conducted 40-minute interviews of friends and family members, keeping a copy and leaving another for submission to the Library of Congress.
</S><S s_id="15">
The founder of Story Corps, David Isay, said many participants had been using their sessions to memorialize dead relatives, so the notion of a booth devoted to stories of Sept. 11 seemed a natural fit.
</S><S s_id="16">
"There's only one thing that's important about the site or September 11, and that's that people were lost," Isay said.
</S><S s_id="17">
"Nothing else matters."
</S><S s_id="18">
For the Sept. 11 project, Isay invited survivors and relatives of victims to make the first recordings at Grand Central.
</S><S s_id="19">
He expects others will go there, too, instead of to the World Trade Center.
</S><S s_id="20">
So far, about 50 people have made Sept. 11 recordings, but cancellations have been common, Isay said.
</S><S s_id="21">
Michael Kuo, 29, whose father was killed on Sept. 11, canceled an appointment in December.
</S><S s_id="22">
"You can set an appointment for December 12, an arbitrary day, and you don't feel it, you don't feel sharp, you can't explain it," Kuo said.
</S><S s_id="23">
For those who have made recordings, the experience has been emotionally complex.
</S><S s_id="24">
Keith Meerholz, 39, who escaped from one of the towers, sat for an interview conducted by his wife, Grete, with help from a Story Corps worker.
</S><S s_id="25">
"I never thought this would be a good thing for people to hear," Meerholz said.
</S><S s_id="26">
"I always thought they would think, 'Why did that son of a bitch get out and not my person?"'
</S><S s_id="27">
The speakers set their own paths.
</S><S s_id="28">
The Leinung family's interview makes no mention of Sept. 11 for the first quarter-hour; the McNeal family brings it up almost at the start of the recording.
</S><S s_id="29">
Because the booth will be open to everyone, not all of the recordings will be on the same emotional plane.
</S><S s_id="30">
Edward Linenthal, a professor of history at Indiana University and the author of "The Unfinished Bombing: Oklahoma City in American Memory," said that policy allowed Isay to avoid some tough choices.
</S><S s_id="31">
In Oklahoma City, he recalled, memorial planners had to decide who had been in enough danger to be considered a survivor.
</S><S s_id="32">
"It allows for a tremendously rich, complex collective memory," Linenthal said.
</S><S s_id="33">
"It also attracts, not so positively, people who would seek to attach themselves to an important moment in history."
</S><S s_id="34">
Mary Marshall Clark, director of the Oral History Research Center at Columbia University and a co-coordinator of the unrelated Sept. 11, 2001, Oral History Narrative and Memory Project, said the booth's value would depend in part on what solace it brings survivors.
</S><S s_id="35">
On that score, she said, the location was not promising.
</S><S s_id="36">
"Ground zero is by its very definition a place of destruction, of the end of life," Clark said.
</S><S s_id="37">
"It's inviting them to re-enter the void, so there should be someone there after the interview."
</S><S s_id="38">
Isay said members of his staff call families after interviews.
</S><S s_id="39">
The notion of speaking at the trade center site appeals to Kuo, who canceled his session last winter.
</S><S s_id="40">
He has a new appointment for July 28, another arbitrary day when he might or might not feel like talking.
</S><S s_id="41">
"I think it's right to do it at the World Trade Center site," Kuo said, "because that's where the spirits are."

CRITICS CALL FOR BOYCOTT OF MEMORIAL FUND-RAISING

CRITICS CALL FOR BOYCOTT OF MEMORIAL FUND-RAISING
</S><S s_id="1">
In the ever fiercer fight over a year-old plan to build a home for the Drawing Center and the International Freedom Center alongside the World Trade Center memorial, some relatives of 9/11 victims called on Monday for a fund-raising boycott.
</S><S s_id="2">
"We urge you to not donate to the World Trade Center memorial until the IFC and the Drawing Center are eliminated from the memorial plans," said "An Open Letter to the American People."
</S><S s_id="3">
The letter appeared on a Web site, Take Back the Memorial, until questions arose over how many of the 14 relatives' groups that were signed to the letter had approved the use of their names.
</S><S s_id="4">
Despite that withdrawal, critics of the cultural plan -- including two members of the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation, which is charged with soliciting contributions -- said the freedom center had to be removed before they would support the use of public money for the overall project.
</S><S s_id="5">
Opponents have objected in advance to what they say will be an anti-American bias to the center's offerings, a charge that the center has just as strongly rejected.
</S><S s_id="6">
"We owe it to the American people or anyone else who wants to donate to tell them what they're paying for and not mislead them," said Debra Burlingame, a foundation board member and one of the letter's authors.
</S><S s_id="7">
She said financing for the memorial would be intermingled with that for the building at Fulton and Greenwich Streets that is intended to house the International Freedom Center and the Drawing Center.
</S><S s_id="8">
The assertion was disputed by Lynn Rasic, the vice president for public affairs at the foundation.
</S><S s_id="9">
"The first fund-raising efforts are devoted to the memorial and the museum dedicated to Sept. 11," she said.
</S><S s_id="10">
"It's unfortunate and wrong to block efforts to make sure that our nation and the world remember those we lost during the attacks," Rasic said.
</S><S s_id="11">
Asked whether it was a conflict of interest for board members to urge prospective donors to withhold support, Rasic said any potential conflicts would be reviewed by the governance committee.
</S><S s_id="12">
Monica Iken, a board member and the founder of September's Mission, which supports the development of a memorial, said she had not approved the use of her group's name on the letter.
</S><S s_id="13">
"I never signed off on anything like that," she said yesterday.
</S><S s_id="14">
"I have an obligation to fund-raise for the memorial," she added.
</S><S s_id="15">
But Burlingame said her objections were in line with her fiduciary responsibilities as a board member.
</S><S s_id="16">
"You can't go out to the public and say, 'We're raising $500 million,' and not tell them they're building on the same site a building so large it will dwarf the memorial," she said.
</S><S s_id="17">
Lee Ielpi, another member of the foundation board, is also vice president of the September 11th Families Association, which was listed as supporting the open letter.
</S><S s_id="18">
"I'm fully comfortable asking Americans who shared our sorrow and came to help us in the worst of times to help us honor our dead and the sacrifice they made," he said.
</S><S s_id="19">
"I am not comfortable asking them to play a role in a political, economic or ideological passion play whose ending has yet to be written.
</S><S s_id="20">
I believe the freedom center is a bad idea."
</S><S s_id="21">
Robert D. Shurbet, the founder of Take Back the Memorial (takebackthememorial.org), said that the open letter was a draft that had been "posted prematurely" and that the link to it was removed "pending final approval" by the relatives' groups.
</S><S s_id="22">
As to the larger issue of the cultural organizations, Stefan Pryor, the president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corp., said officials were having "continuing conversations with the two institutions regarding their response" to concerns raised by Gov. George E. Pataki.
</S><S s_id="23">
On June 24, the governor asked for an "absolute guarantee" that programs on the site not denigrate America or offend victims' families.
</S><S s_id="24">
Eric Foner, the DeWitt Clinton professor of history at Columbia University, resigned from the freedom center's committee of scholars and advisers early this month, after a letter from the center to Pryor that tried to address those concerns.
</S><S s_id="25">
News of his resignation was reported on Saturday in The New York Post.

Alternative locations for the Drawing Center on and off the trade center site are already being explored

EDITORIAL: A SENSE OF PROPORTION AT GROUND ZERO
</HEADLINE><TEXT><S s_id="0">
EDITORIAL: A SENSE OF PROPORTION AT GROUND ZERO
</S><S s_id="1">
The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 29:
</S><S s_id="2">
Somewhere in the ill-conceived campaign to "take back the memorial" at ground zero, false impressions have managed to triumph over facts.
</S><S s_id="3">
This week, Debra Burlingame, a board member of the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation, and others called for a boycott of fundraising for the memorial until the International Freedom Center and the Drawing Center have been banished from ground zero.
</S><S s_id="4">
She argues that money for the memorial will be intermingled with funds for the cultural building that is supposed to house the Freedom Center and the Drawing Center.
</S><S s_id="5">
This is both misleading and harmful to the memorial itself.
</S><S s_id="6">
The World Trade Center Memorial Foundation has pledged that its first priority is to build the memorial and create an endowment for it.
</S><S s_id="7">
Private donors are free to specify how they choose to have their money spent.
</S><S s_id="8">
The attacks on the International Freedom Center -- and, more broadly, on the cultural component of Daniel Libeskind's master plan -- make it all too easy to forget the existence of a Memorial Museum that is devoted wholly to the events of 9/11.
</S><S s_id="9">
Opponents of the Freedom Center, like Burlingame, claim that the Memorial Museum will be dwarfed by the cultural center.
</S><S s_id="10">
In fact, they overstate the size of the Snohetta building, which is being scaled back for other reasons, and they have exaggerated the floor space allotted there for the International Freedom Center.
</S><S s_id="11">
They also make it sound as if the Memorial Museum, which at 50,000 square feet is larger than the public spaces in the Whitney Museum, is somehow an afterthought relegated to the basement.
</S><S s_id="12">
It will be built underground, but that is because the 9/11 families asked to have access to the bedrock and to what remains of the foundation of the twin towers.
</S><S s_id="13">
To argue over the size of these two spaces is to assume that emotional power is solely the result of square footage.
</S><S s_id="14">
It is also to forget the profound effect that going to the roots of the World Trade Center will have on most visitors.
</S><S s_id="15">
But this is not really a campaign about money or space.
</S><S s_id="16">
It is a campaign about political purity -- about how people remember 9/11 and about how we choose to read its aftermath, including the Iraq war.
</S><S s_id="17">
On their Web site, www.takebackthememorial.org, critics of the cultural plan at ground zero offer a resolution called Campaign America.
</S><S s_id="18">
It says that ground zero must contain no facilities "that house controversial debate, dialogue, artistic impressions, or exhibits referring to extraneous historical events."
</S><S s_id="19">
This, to us, sounds un-American.

Temporary 9/11 memorials unveiled
</S><S s_id="1">
New York Governor George Pataki joined victims' family members, survivors, and rescue workers Thursday in laying out a timetable for two temporary Sept. 11 memorials.
</S><S s_id="2">
One project is an oral history booth called "StoryCorps."
</S><S s_id="3">
Set up in the PATH station at the World Trade Center site, it will have audio recordings featuring memories of loved ones and the events of Sept. 11.
</S><S s_id="4">
The memorial will open to the public on July 12.
</S><S s_id="5">
The permanent memorial, part of the trade center site redevelopment, is due to open in 2009.
</S><S s_id="6">
Governor Pataki said it was important to have temporary memorials to help the victims' loved ones and help tourists understand what happened there.
</S><S s_id="7">
"You come down here any time, any day and there are people looking down at the site and imagining in their minds what happened on Sept. 11," said Pataki.
</S><S s_id="8">
"Now they can still do that, but then they'll be able to go across the street to the tribute center and be told the actual story by people who understand it and by people who were there on that day."
</S><S s_id="9">
The other project is the Tribute, set to open in March next year at a now-vacant storefront and basement at Liberty Street.
</S><S s_id="10">
The center will house a gallery, exhibits and education programs, and will offer walking tours around the trade center site.
</S><S s_id="11">
The interim memorials will serve as outlets for information about the attacks until the permanent memorial is built.
